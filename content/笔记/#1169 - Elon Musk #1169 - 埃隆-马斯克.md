## Highlights
- In some measure, the success of these online systems is sort of a function of how much limbic resonance they're able to achieve with people. The more limbic resonance, the more engagement. 
  在某种程度上，这些在线系统的成功与否，取决于它们能与人们产生多少边缘共鸣。边缘共鸣越多，参与度就越高。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv63v7j1qm3w5n0nmeyca2dq))
- Well, that's the scenario the merge scenario with AI is the one that seems Like probably the best like for us. 
  好吧，这就是与人工智能合并的方案，对我们来说可能是最好的方案。
  24:33
  Yes, like if you if you can't Beat it join it that's Yeah, you know So From a long term existential standpoint,that's like the purpose of Neuralink is to create a high bandwidth interface to the brain such that we can be symbiotic with AI because we have a bandwidth problem. 
  是的，如果你不能打败它，那就加入它吧 从长远的生存角度来看，神经链路的目的就是创造一个高带宽的大脑接口，这样我们就能与人工智能共生，因为我们有带宽问题。

  You just can't communicate through your fingers. It's too slow. 
  你无法通过手指进行交流。太慢了 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv63yy8qxk8xka2r5hrh9ek9))
- I haven't met anyone who wants to delete their limbic system or delete their cortex. Everybody seems to like both. And the cortex is mostly in service to the limbic system. 
  我还没见过谁想删除自己的边缘系统或大脑皮层。每个人似乎都喜欢两者兼得。而大脑皮层主要是为边缘系统服务的。
  26:16
  People may think that That the thinking part of themselves is in charge,but it's mostly their limbic system that's in charge,and the cortex is trying to make the limbic system happy. 
  人们可能会认为是自己的思维部分在起作用，但其实主要是边缘系统在起作用，大脑皮层在努力让边缘系统开心。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv641nnfcbe8x7zvdsran67k))
- It will be difficult to really appreciate the difference. It's kind of like how much smarter are you with a phone or computer than without. It's you're vastly smarter actually. 
  你很难真正体会到其中的差别。这就有点像有手机或电脑的人比没有手机或电脑的人要聪明得多。实际上，你要聪明得多。
  28:33
  You know, you can answer any question if you connect to the internet. You can answer any question pretty much instantly, any calculation. Your phone's memory is essentially perfect. You can remember flawlessly. 
  只要连上互联网，你就可以回答任何问题。你几乎可以立即回答任何问题，任何计算。你的手机内存基本上是完美的。你可以完美无瑕地记忆。
  28:47
  Your phone can remember videos, pictures, everything perfectly. Your phone is already an extension of you. You're already a cyborg. Well, most people don't realize they are already a cyborg. That phone is an extension of yourself. 
  您的手机可以完美地记住视频、图片和一切。你的手机已经是你的延伸。你已经是个半机械人了。大多数人都没有意识到自己已经是个半机械人了。手机是你的延伸
  29:07
  It's just that the data rate, the communication rate between you and the cybernetic extension of yourself, that is your phone and computer, is slow. It's very slow. 
  只是数据传输速率，也就是你与你自己的电子扩展（即你的手机和电脑）之间的通信速率很慢。非常慢。
  29:22
  And that is like a tiny straw of information flow between your biological self and your digital self. And we need to make that tiny straw like a giant river, a huge high bandwidth interface. It's an interface problem, data rate problem. 
  这就像生物自我和数字自我之间的一根微小的信息流稻草。我们需要把这根小稻草变成一条大河，一个巨大的高带宽接口。这是一个接口问题，数据速率问题。
  29:47
  Solve the data rate problem, I think we can hang on to human machines and bioses through the long term, and then people may decide that they want to retain their biological self or not. 
  解决了数据传输速率的问题，我认为我们就可以长期保留人类机器和生物，然后人们可以决定是否要保留生物自我。
  30:04
  I think they'll probably choose to retain their biological self. 
  我想他们可能会选择保留自己的生物学本体。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv643dhez2br2pq84cmdwm76))
- There's nothing you know it's not you do stop certain terrible ideas from propagating Yeah Anyway, I don't want to sound like like things are too dark because I think like you kind of have to I Be optimistic about the future. 
  总之，我不想说得太黑暗，因为我觉得你必须对未来保持乐观。
  47:11
  There's no point in being pessimistic. It's just too negative. It doesn't help. It doesn't help. You know, I think you want to be, I mean, my theory is like, you'd rather be optimistic. 
  悲观是没有意义的。太消极了。没有任何帮助。没用的你知道，我觉得你想成为， 我的意思是，我的理论是一样， 你宁愿是乐观的。
  47:24
  I think I'd rather be optimistic and wrong than pessimistic and right. At least or on that side. 
  我想我宁愿乐观而错误，也不愿悲观而正确。至少或在那一边。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv64r73qcr5thz3fh9q55fs8))
- Well, when we create a simulation, like a game or a movie, it's a distillation of what's interesting about life. It takes a year to shoot an action movie, and then that's all distilled down into two or three hours. 
  嗯，当我们创造一个模拟游戏或电影时，它是对生活中有趣事物的提炼。拍摄一部动作片需要一年的时间，而这一切都要提炼成两三个小时。
  49:49
  So let me tell you, if you see an action movie being filmed, it's friggin boring, super boring. It takes, there's like lots of takes. There's everything's in a green screen. It looks pretty goofy. It doesn't look cool. 
  让我告诉你，如果你看到一部动作片正在拍摄，那真是无聊透顶，超级无聊。要拍很多遍所有东西都是绿屏的看起来很傻看起来一点都不酷
  50:04
  But once you add the CGI and have great editing, it's amazing. So I think most likely if we're a simulation, it's really boring outside the simulation. Because why would you make a simulation that's boring? 
  但一旦加入 CGI 和出色的剪辑，效果就会令人惊叹。所以我认为，如果我们是模拟的，那么模拟之外就会很无聊。因为你为什么要做一个无聊的模拟呢？
  50:23
  Because make simulation way more interesting than base reality. 
  因为模拟比现实更有趣。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv64vx6wknx22bgxvs01tfem))
- I mean, I think a Tesla is the most fun thing you could possibly buy ever. That's what it's meant to be well our goal is to make it's It's not exactly a car. 
  我是说，我觉得特斯拉是你能买到的 最有趣的东西了这就是它的意义所在 我们的目标是让它成为一辆真正的汽车
  58:16
  It's actually a thing to maximize enjoyment Make its maximum fun Okay electronic like big screen laptop ridiculous speed handling all that stuff Yeah. And we're going to put video games in it. 
  它实际上是一种能最大限度享受乐趣的东西 好吧，就像大屏幕笔记本电脑那样的电子设备 速度快得令人发指，能处理所有这些东西 是啊。我们要把电子游戏放 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv64zt3d4gdyzjhsnszvtz5z))
- Like your Tesla's soup. It's like the far end of electronics. 
  就像特斯拉的汤就像电子产品的远端。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv653gpx514swr6d9xwp4ycr))
- This is one of the fundamental things people don't appreciate about tunnels is that it's not like roads. The fundamental issue with roads is that you have a 2d Transport system and a 3D living and workspace environment. 
  人们不了解隧道的根本原因之一就是它与公路不同。道路的根本问题在于，你有一个二维的交通系统和一个三维的生活和工作环境。
  1:05:59
  So you got all these tall buildings or concentrated work environments and then you want to go into this like 2D transport system which is pretty low density because cars are spaced out pretty far and so that obviously is not going to work. 
  因此，你有了这些高楼大厦或集中的工作环境，然后你又想进入像 2D 交通系统这样的低密度系统，因为汽车的间距非常远，所以这显然是行不通的。
  1:06:17
  You're going to have traffic guaranteed, but if you can go 3D on your transport system, then you can solve all traffic. You can either go 3D up with a flying car, or you can go 3D down with tunnels. 
  交通是有保障的，但如果你能在交通系统上实现 3D 化，就能解决所有交通问题。你可以用飞行汽车来实现三维立体交通，也可以用隧道来实现三维立体交通。
  1:06:30
  You can have as many tunnel levels as you want, and you can arbitrarily relieve any amount of traffic. You can go further down with tunnels than you can go up with buildings. You're 10,000 feet down if you want. 
  你可以拥有任意多的隧道层，也可以任意缓解任何数量的交通。有了隧道，就能比有了楼房走得更远。只要你愿意，你可以向下延伸 10,000 英尺。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv655dg4qdp2exq4xbzk2h3d))
- The interesting thing about an electric plane is that you want to go as high as possible, but you need a certain energy density in the battery pack because you have to overcome gravitational potential energy. 
  电动飞机的有趣之处在于，你想飞得越高越好，但电池组需要一定的能量密度，因为你必须克服重力势能。
  1:16:30
  Once you've overcome gravitational potential energy and you're at a high altitude, the energy you use in cruise is very low. And then you can recapture a large part of the gravitational potential energy on the way down. 
  一旦你克服了重力势能，并处于高空，你在巡航时消耗的能量就会非常低。然后，你可以在下降途中重新获得大部分重力势能。
  1:16:44
  So you really don't need any kind of reserve fuel, if you will, because you have the energy of height, gravitational potential energy. This is a lot of energy. So once you can get high, the way to think about a plane is it's a force balance. 
  因此，你真的不需要任何储备燃料，因为你有高度能，重力势能。这是很大的能量。所以一旦你能飞到高处，你就会想到飞机是一种力平衡。
  1:17:02
  So the force balance So a plane that is not accelerating is a neutral force balance. You have the force of gravity, you have the lift force of the wings, 
  因此，没有加速的飞机的力平衡是中性的。你有重力，你有机翼的升力、
  1:17:16
  then you've got the force of the thrusting device, the propeller or turbine or whatever it is, and you've got the resistance force of the air. Now,the higher you go,the lower the air resistance is. 
  然后是推力装置、螺旋桨或涡轮或其他任何装置的推力，以及空气阻力。现在，你飞得越高，空气阻力就越小。
  1:17:32
  Air density drops exponentially,but drag increases with the square,and exponential beats the square. 
  空气密度以指数形式下降，但阻力随平方而增加，指数大于平方。
  1:17:38
  The higher you go,the faster you will go for the same amount of energy,and at a certain altitude,you can go supersonic with less energy per mile,quite a lot less energy per mile than an aircraft at 35,000 feet,because it's just a force balance. 
  在相同能量的情况下，飞行高度越高，速度就越快。在一定高度上，超音速飞行每英里所需的能量更少，比 35000 英尺高度的飞机每英里所需的能量要少得多，因为这只是力的平衡。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv659rmgzrh5zy2xwjxdj3x6))
- Not that SpaceX is, SpaceX is no walk in the park, but a car company, it's very difficult to keep a car company alive. It's very difficult. 
  不是说 SpaceX，SpaceX 也不是在公园里散步，而是一家汽车公司，要让一家汽车公司继续生存下去是非常困难的。这是非常困难的。
  1:53:23
  You know, there's only two car companies in the history of American car companies that haven't gone bankrupt, and that's Ford and Tesla. That's it. 
  要知道，在美国汽车公司的历史上，只有两家汽车公司没有破产，那就是福特和特斯拉。就是这样 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv65hgfpkjt2sp96qjy8pc65))

- No, I think, you know, I think people should be nicer to each other and give more credit to others and don't assume that they're mean until you know they're actually mean. You know, just... It's easy to demonize people. 
  不，我觉得，你知道，我觉得人们应该对彼此好一点，多给别人一些信任，在你知道他们真的很刻薄之前，不要认为他们很刻薄。你知道，只是...把人妖魔化很容易
  2:36:13
  You're usually wrong about it. People are nicer than you think. Give people more credit. 
  你通常都错了。人们比你想象的要好。给人们更多的信任。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv66xna4sf1d2jjx8btddz82))
