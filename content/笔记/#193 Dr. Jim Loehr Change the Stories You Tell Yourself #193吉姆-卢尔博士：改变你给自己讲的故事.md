- Another one is, is this story that I'm telling myself, is it aligned with the best part of me, with who I really want to be in life, my values, my sense of purpose? Does this story take me where I want to go in life? 
  另一个问题是，我给自己讲的这个故事是否符合我内心最美好的部分，是否符合我真正想要成为的人，我的价值观，我的目标感？这个故事能带我到达我想去的地方吗？ ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hx1ez14rdr1xkj98w0esc0a8))
- I love the nature of writing. We encourage that with sort of decision journals and as the means by which we can reflect or one of the ways by which we can reflect. And one of the ways which we can learn to think as well. 
  我喜欢写作的本质。我们鼓励写决定日记，并将其作为我们反思的手段或反思的方式之一。这也是我们学习思考的方法之一。

  So not only do we discover through writing that we don't know what we're talking about always, but we discover new ideas and we come to a new understanding. It's so powerful as a form. 
  因此，通过写作，我们不仅能发现自己并不总是知道自己在说什么，还能发现新的想法，获得新的理解。作为一种形式，它是如此强大。

  纵观历史，大多数被我们视为历史伟人的人或多或少都写过日记。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hx1fa16cs20xxjt4qztypz0a))
