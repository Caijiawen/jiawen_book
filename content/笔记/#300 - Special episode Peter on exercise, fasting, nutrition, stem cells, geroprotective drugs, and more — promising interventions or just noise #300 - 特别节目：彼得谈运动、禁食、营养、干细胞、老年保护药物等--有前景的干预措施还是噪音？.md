- Summary: The 300th episode of The Drive Podcast discusses aging, geroprotective drugs, exercise, and nutrition, classifying topics based on evidence and potential. Geroprotective drugs like rapamycin and metformin show promise, but more research is needed. Understanding the impact of NAD precursors and the challenges of stem cell treatment are areas requiring further study.

## Highlights
- Q: Why are VO2 max, muscle mass, and strength considered the greatest predictors of lifespan? 
  问：为什么最大容氧量、肌肉质量和力量被认为是预测寿命的最重要因素？
  A: VO2 max, muscle mass, and strength are considered the greatest predictors of lifespan because they reflect the potent impact of exercise on the cellular processes of aging. These measures cannot be achieved quickly; they require consistent effort over time. 
  答：最大氧饱和度、肌肉质量和力量被认为是预测寿命的最重要指标，因为它们反映了运动对细胞衰老过程的有力影响。这些指标不可能很快达到，需要长期坚持不懈的努力。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hx9b811a5asbgkzhfn9jt11r))
