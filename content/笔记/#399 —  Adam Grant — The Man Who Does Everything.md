## Highlights
- Create a User Manual of Yourself for Others
  Key takeaways:
  - He learned that he had blind spots when it came to working with new people, and that he needed to be aware of these weaknesses in order to be more effective.
  - He also learned that he needed to ask his team for help in creating a user manual for him, in order to ensure that he was always aware of his strengths and weaknesses.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  He said, you know, when i buy a new car, it comes with an owner's manual, so i know how to operate it. But when i work with a new person, whose way more complex than a car, i don't get anything. And so i'm kind of starting from square one, when fact, they have all these experiences that could teach me something from their past about how to work with them better in the present and the future. And so what he did, same as orschol nick, he sat down and he wrote up one pager on how to work with him effectively. What are his strength what are his weaknesses, what are the triggers that bring out the worst in him? What are the the moments that bring out in the best in him? And then he didn't stop therehe asked his team to write their user manual for him, so that he could gauge his own self awareness. And of course, he found the team's os is much more ecihtful and accurate than his own, because of the blind spot factor in part. But now every new person who works with him gets that one pager and gets to immediately start as if they'd known him for a month or two, and say, ok, you know, here are the things i might want to adapt if i want to be really affective with this nager. And so i've gone, i've gone and done that. I asked a bunch of people who worke with me to write my user manual. Andit is very simple. The questions are, what are my strengths? What brings those out? What are my weaknesses? What brings those out? What are my blind spots? And what do you know now about working with me that you wish you had known when we first started working?
  Speaker 2
  Again, great, invaluable.
  Speaker 1
  Whatis what are some of the answers to that, lask. But the last one, i've got a few funny ones. One one that really caught me off guard was, it really bothers you deeply at your core when somebody pretends to know something that they don't. You just all of a sudden go from being a pretty friendly, affable person toto, just an intense prosecutor. Which was novel. Novel observation for me. I got it. I got another one that said that, i, i think the exact quote, was that, i am unaware that sometimes when i say an idea is not good, i've just crushed somebody's three months faith invested in that ideaand here i am thinking i'm helping them move on, you know, more efficiently, and not not at all aware how much they've already invested in the idea.
  Speaker 2
  So, well, you maybe you're doing both, i think that better, probably do it betterbetter, better to crush three months of effort and saved them the next three years. ([Time 1:31:50](https://share.snipd.com/snip/2fc69285-ed29-47f9-97e0-a312f79315a1))
