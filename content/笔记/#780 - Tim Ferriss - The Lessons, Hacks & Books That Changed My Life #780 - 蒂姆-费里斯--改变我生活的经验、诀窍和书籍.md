## Highlights
- Before I ever started Modern Wisdom in 2018, I listened to a podcast from Tim called How to Release a Podcast in 2017. So he was the guy that taught me how to launch a show. Before he even knew who I was and before this show even existed. 
  在2018年创办《现代智慧》之前，我在2017年听了蒂姆的播客《如何发布播客》。因此，是他教会了我如何发布一档节目。在他还不知道我是谁之前，在这个节目还没有出现之前。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxn5csvxxqkxahjvdwjb6mse))
- But I think the choosing what you do matters a lot more than how you do any one given thing. So I do think I'm good at picking, let's call it lead dominoes that tip over other things. 
  但我认为，选择做什么比如何做某一件事重要得多。因此，我认为我很擅长选择，我们称之为 "多米诺骨牌"。
  02:53
  So high leverage targets that tend to make other things irrelevant or a lot easier. So I'm good at that. But in the actual execution, I think I look like a drowning monkey a lot of the time. 
  因此，高杠杆目标往往会让其他事情变得无关紧要或容易得多。所以我很擅长这些。但在实际执行中，我觉得自己很多时候就像一只溺水的猴子。
  03:04
  So I would say there is some truth to it, but I would probably replace efficiency with effectiveness. And then in the last 10 to 15 years, I think I've de-optimized A lot. 
  因此，我认为这是有一定道理的，但我可能会用有效性来取代效率。在过去的 10 到 15 年里，我想我已经去优化了很多。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxn6ts7c6ty4sqw18tq9x2v9))
- Since, for instance, if you're running a marathon, you're not going to take a taxi from point A to point B. Sure, that'll be efficient, but that sort of defeats the purpose of the whole exercise. 
  比如说，如果你要跑马拉松，就不会从 A 点打车到 B 点。
  03:22
  So there's a lot more that I would put in that process over outcome category, I would say. 
  因此，我认为过程比结果更重要。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxn6vpnbq79q3dbvd8ms9y1w))
- So effectiveness is, there are different ways to look at this. The way I look at it is effectiveness is what you do. Efficiency is how you do something. But doing something well does not make it important or high leverage. 
  因此，有效性有不同的理解方式。我的看法是，有效性就是你做了什么。效率是你如何做某事。但是，做得好并不意味着它就重要或杠杆率高。
  03:41
  Does that make sense? So if you do an 80-20 analysis and you determine say in learning a language that if you learn the thousand highest frequency words, you're going to be conversationally fluent. 
  这样说有道理吗？因此，如果你做一个 80-20 分析，并确定在学习一门语言时，如果你学会了一千个频率最高的单词，你就能流利地进行会话。
  03:52
  Choosing that subset of vocabulary and then studying it at a B minus level is better than choosing the wrong set of vocabulary and studying at an A plus level. 
  选择这部分词汇，然后以 B 负的水平学习，比选择错误的词汇集，以 A 正的水平学习要好。
  04:03
  So the what matters more than the how or the material matters more than the method. The task that you choose matters more than how you do any given task. That's how I tend to think about it. 
  因此，"做什么 "比 "怎么做 "更重要，"材料 "比 "方法 "更重要。你选择的任务比你如何完成任务更重要。这就是我的想法。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxn71rhn74v2gwr2peysnhs9))

- Could not tell you what major projects I've driven forward in any meaningful way. So as long as you choose the highest leverage As long as you have a system for choosing what is important, 
  我无法告诉你我以任何有意义的方式推动了哪些重大项目。因此，只要你选择了最高杠杆，只要你有一个选择重要事项的系统、
  05:30
  because that's going to be subjective, then over time I think you can snowball your way into long-term success again as you define it. 
  因为这是很主观的，所以随着时间的推移，我认为你可以通过滚雪球的方式再次获得长期成功，就像你定义的那样。
  05:38
  Having those definitions for yourself is important, otherwise you're going to be flailing around or mimicking other people and I think that can end up leading you in a lot of conflicting directions. 
  为自己下定义很重要，否则你就会到处乱窜或模仿别人，我认为这最终会把你引向许多相互矛盾的方向。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxrar5ezyw83y2nfhz7mjs3r))
- I really tend to focus in the short term and it'll be clear why that works in the long term in a second. 
  我确实倾向于在短期内集中精力，这一点从长远来看马上就会明白。
  06:58
  If I ask myself which of these will help me to develop or deepen skills, develop or deepen relationships the most, even if they fail by external metrics, I bias towards choosing that project. 
  如果我问自己，在这些项目中，哪一个最能帮助我发展或深化技能、发展或深化人际关系，即使它们的外部指标不合格，我也会偏向于选择那个项目。
  07:13
  And then even if it fails initially by whatever external metric you might have or perception of the public, as long as those skills and relationships transfer, they persist after that project, 
  然后，即使从外部指标或公众的看法来看，项目最初失败了，但只要这些技能和关系得以转移，它们就会在项目结束后继续存在、
  07:28
  Those will accumulate over time and so far my experience has been they lead to better success. 
  这些都会随着时间的推移不断积累，迄今为止，我的经验是它们会带来更好的成功。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxrb459wn8822wfbgtjqkern))
- three years, five years, and you're viewing things as experiments as opposed to like closed-loop success or failure, binary outcomes, then it's all feedback. 
  三年、五年，你把事情看作实验，而不是闭环的成功或失败，二元结果，那么它就是所有的反馈。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxrb866dap8ysf9v0ny0j06e))
- And my own experience has been that if I put my all into shorter term projects, let's just say three months, within that I have two to four week experiments that I'm running of various types. 
  我自己的经验是，如果我把全部精力投入到较短期的项目中，比方说三个月，那么在这三个月内，我会进行两到四周的各种类型的实验。
  09:17
  Number one, that's kind of semantic insurance against psychological distress from quote-unquote failure. 
  第一，这是一种语义上的保险，可以避免因引述失败而产生的心理压力。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxrb8t1b0gzrktgvy9w05xna))

- Me starting the podcast 2014. So I launched The 4-Hour Chef, which was a very difficult book. I mean, it was a three, four-year project that was crammed into a year, year and a half. It was a suicide mission of sorts. 
  2014年，我开始做播客。于是我推出了《4小时大厨》，这是一本非常困难的书。我的意思是，这是一个耗时三四年的项目，压缩在一年或一年半的时间里。可以说是一项自杀式的任务。
  10:09
  Got it done at incredible personal cost. Yay. Go masochism. And in the process of promoting the book, doing the launch, I always look for the uncrowded high leverage channel. 
  以难以置信的个人代价完成了它。耶去受虐吧。在推广新书、举办发布会的过程中，我一直在寻找人迹罕至的高杠杆渠道。
  10:23
  Which is increasing in impact and importance at that time that was podcasting. For the first book it was blogs. So every time I launch a book I'm looking for that. 
  在当时，播客的影响力和重要性与日俱增。第一本书是博客。因此，每当我推出一本书时，我都会寻找这种方式。
  10:32
  And I put all the chips into podcasts and I had the opportunity to be interviewed on Rogan Show and Nerdist and many, many others. And that was when I became very interested in the format and I saw how with some basic trends at play, 
  我把所有的筹码都投入到播客中，我有机会接受《罗根秀》、《Nerdist》和许多其他节目的采访。就在那时，我对播客这种形式产生了浓厚的兴趣，并看到了一些基本趋势是如何发挥作用的、 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxrbgzw3r03b4kmh740cabwt))
- here's how I think about the skill development, improve my ability to ask questions, reduce my verbal tics. I refine my ability to interview which would transfer to my future nonfiction books which require a lot of research. 
  我是这样看待技能发展的：提高提问能力，减少语言抽搐。我提高了自己的采访能力，这将有助于我今后出版需要进行大量研究的非虚构类图书。
  11:48
  I would also have the ability to deepen my relationships with my close friends. Example, my first episode with Kevin Rose because otherwise doing hours and hours of Google sleuthing on your friends is pretty creepy. 
  我还能加深与好友的关系。比如，我和凯文-罗斯（Kevin Rose）的第一集，因为如果不这样做，在谷歌上对你的朋友进行数小时的调查是非常令人毛骨悚然的。
  11:58
  And having a one-way conversation for two hours is also pretty bizarre. But with the podcast I would have the pretext that would allow that and to reach out to people ultimately who I would want to get to know. 
  两个小时的单向对话也很奇怪。但有了播客，我就有了这样的借口，最终可以接触到我想了解的人 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxrbkz5zj920tcss6szyt67e))

- No, you have no idea. And I would also say that I think the, The short-term experimentalism and the long-term planning are not mutually exclusive, 
  不，你根本不知道。我还想说的是，我认为短期实验主义和长期规划并不相互排斥、
  13:27
  but the long-term planning that I've seen executed really well is usually executed by people who are top 1% of 1% in a single field, whereas I don't have, as best I can tell, that degree of expertise. I'm more of a generalist. 
  但我所见过的那些执行得非常好的长期规划，通常都是由那些在某一领域排名前 1%的人执行的，而我，据我所知，并不具备那种程度的专业知识。我更像是一个通才。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxrbqc3ytqj94qjv7daqj7eq))
- Whereas I think I am more of a generalist in the sense that I might be top 20% in a few things when you overlap them in an event diagram that allow me to try to, try to, not always succeeding, be a category of one. 
  而我认为自己更像是一个通才，当你把几件事重叠在一个事件图中时，我可能会在几件事中占前 20%，这让我可以尝试成为一类人，但并不总是成功。
  14:26
  So I'm attempting to be the only and not the best. It's a great book called The Blue Ocean Strategy that I recommend people read as you think about this. And there's also a chapter in a book called The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing. 
  因此，我试图成为唯一的，而不是最好的。在你思考这个问题的时候，我推荐大家阅读一本名为《蓝海战略》的好书。在一本名为《营销的 22 条不变法则》的书中，也有这样一个章节。
  14:39
  It's a bit outdated in some ways, but the original version Has examples of something they call the law of category, which is simply attempting to create new categories versus dominate crowded existing categories. 
  这本书在某些方面已经有点过时了，但最初的版本有一些他们称之为 "类别法则 "的例子，简单地说，就是试图创建新的类别，而不是主宰拥挤的现有类别。
  14:55
  And I think that's a helpful exercise, not just for branding and marketing purposes, but for positioning. And then when you think about positioning, you can work backwards from that and create the product. 
  我认为这是一个很有帮助的练习，不只是为了品牌和营销目的，也是为了定位。然后，当你想好了定位，你就可以以此为基础倒推，创造出产品。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxrbzyemxm9svh4k4ar687vs))

- It's not super highly variable, but there is some variation, right? So if I feel like monkey mind is getting the best of me, probably something like journaling, whether it's morning pages or five-minute journal is what I'll do. 
  虽然变化不是很大，但还是有一些变化的，对吧？所以，如果我觉得我的大脑被 "猴子 "控制了，我就会写日记，不管是晨间日记还是五分钟日记。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxrcmwj52d3q3x9pg21p4eth))
- Oh, yeah, exactly. And then the second half of the day for a few hours were reserved for the most important high leverage business activities often revolving around on Mondays and Fridays, for instance, recording. 
  哦，是的，没错。然后下半天的几个小时就留给了最重要的高杠杆业务活动，通常围绕着周一和周五，比如录音。
  19:15
  So set days for recording, set times for recording, 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. We can go into the reasons for that. Tuesday, team calls. 
  因此，录音的日期和时间都是固定的，上午 10 点和下午 3 点。周二，团队通话。
  19:24
  I find that weekly architecture for me, and I'm not the only person who does this, there's some very well-known tech CEOs who also do this. 
  我发现每周一次的架构设计对我来说很有帮助，我不是唯一这样做的人，一些非常知名的科技公司首席执行官也是这样做的。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxrd62hwa222b5hx2a5t2kpe))
- if you are the CEO or or a solopreneur, If you're making too many decisions, that is as fatal as making some of the wrong decisions. Too many decisions will also kill you. 
  如果你是首席执行官或个体经营者，如果你做了太多的决定，那就像做了一些错误的决定一样致命。过多的决定也会要了你的命。
  20:20
  So I would say that the morning generally for me, the thread is do not feel rushed for the first hour. If I feel rushed for the first hour, I'm gonna feel rushed for the whole day. 
  所以我想说，对我来说，早晨的主线是不要在第一个小时感到匆忙。如果我在第一个小时感到匆忙，那么我一整天都会感到匆忙。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxrda3kp2km7hnp5trrnt7e3))

- And on some level, that's true in so much as money is a vehicle for doing certain things, preventing certain things. But It doesn't fix the inner game and it's an amplifier just like alcohol, power, fame.

  1:06:45
  If you are solely fixated on one thing, you're too vulnerable to black swan events or simply ups and downs due to variables that are outside of your control. So in contrast, if you have your Saturday workout or you have your deadlift,

- I have a very deliberate, I would say low information diet or I have very tight filters. So small group of friends who send me things, podcast guests who make recommendations. Those would also be included oftentimes in my friend group. 
  我有一个非常谨慎的饮食习惯，我想说的是低信息量饮食习惯，或者说我有非常严格的筛选标准。所以，我的朋友圈里都是些给我发东西的小伙伴，播客嘉宾也会给我推荐一些东西。这些也会经常被纳入我的朋友圈。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxs5dppasgd2qmgh74rhsh8t))
- The main thing that's happened is I just didn't stop. And it shows the power of compounding and consistency. And like, it's weird to think that consistency is a selection mechanism in itself. 
  最主要的是，我没有停下脚步。这说明了复利和一致性的力量。想想看，一致性本身就是一种选择机制。

  Like, that simply doing a thing more makes you better, regardless of the quality that you do it at, and over time you will get better by doing it, but that consistency is so rare. 
  比如，只要多做一件事就会让你变得更好，不管你做这件事的质量如何，随着时间的推移，你会通过做这件事变得更好，但这种一致性是如此罕见。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxs5vf9ff0jnzrj6wzb6zne9))
