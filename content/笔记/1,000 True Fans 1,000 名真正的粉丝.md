## Highlights
- A true fan is defined as a fan that will buy anything you produce. These diehard fans will drive 200 miles to see you sing; they will buy the hardback and paperback and audible versions of your book; they will purchase your next figurine sight unseen; they will pay for the “best-of” DVD version of your free youtube channel; they will come to your chef’s table once a month. If you have roughly a thousand of true fans like this (also known as super fans), you can make a living — if you are content to make a living but not a fortune. 
  真正的粉丝是指会购买你生产的任何产品的粉丝。这些铁杆粉丝会驱车 200 英里来看你唱歌；他们会购买你的书的精装版、平装版和有声版；他们会买下你的下一个公仔，一睹为快；他们会为你免费的 youtube 频道的 "精选 "DVD 版本买单；他们会每个月去你的厨师餐桌一次。如果你拥有大约一千名这样的真正粉丝（也称为超级粉丝），你就可以谋生--如果你满足于谋生而不是发财的话。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsw1qsb74b1gd1vpzfv3v2b2))
- Here’s how the math works. You need to meet two criteria. First, you have to create enough each year that you can earn, on average, $100 profit from each true fan. That is easier to do in some arts and businesses than others, but it is a good creative challenge in every area because it is always easier and better to give your existing customers more, than it is to find new fans. 
  计算方法如下。你需要满足两个标准。首先，你必须每年创造出足够多的作品，平均每个真正的粉丝能给你带来 100 美元的利润。这在某些艺术和商业领域比在其他领域更容易做到，但在每个领域都是一个很好的创意挑战，因为给现有客户更多，总是比寻找新粉丝更容易、更好。
  Second, you must have a direct relationship with your fans. That is, they must pay you directly. You get to keep all of their support, unlike the small percent of their fees you might get from a music label, publisher, studio, retailer, or other intermediate. If you keep the full $100 of each true fan, then you need only 1,000 of them to earn $100,000 per year. That’s a living for most folks. 
  其次，你必须与粉丝建立直接关系。也就是说，他们必须直接付钱给你。你可以保留他们的全部支持，而不像从音乐厂牌、出版商、工作室、零售商或其他中间商那里获得他们的一小部分费用。如果你能留住每个真正粉丝的 100 美元，那么你只需要 1000 个粉丝，每年就能赚到 10 万美元。这对大多数人来说都是一笔不小的收入。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsw1rhy6vawp7djq0m604pez))
- A thousand customers is a whole lot more feasible to aim for than a million fans. Millions of paying fans is not a realistic goal to shoot for, especially when you are starting out. But a thousand fans is doable. You might even be able to remember a thousand names. If you added one new true fan per day, it’d only take a few years to gain a thousand. 
  一千名客户比一百万名粉丝的目标要可行得多。百万付费粉丝并不是一个现实的目标，尤其是当你刚起步时。但一千个粉丝是可以做到的。你甚至可以记住一千个名字。如果你每天增加一个真正的新粉丝，那么只需要几年时间就能获得一千个粉丝。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsw1s29pgc4jhrsdgrpnngsy))
- The takeaway: 1,000 true fans is an alternative path to success other than stardom. Instead of trying to reach the narrow and unlikely peaks of platinum bestseller hits, blockbusters, and celebrity status, you can aim for direct connection with a thousand true fans. On your way, no matter how many fans you actually succeed in gaining, you’ll be surrounded not by faddish infatuation, but by genuine and true appreciation. It’s a much saner destiny to hope for. And you are much more likely to actually arrive there. 
  启示1000 名忠实粉丝是通往明星之外的另一条成功之路。与其试图达到白金畅销书销量、大片和名人地位这些狭隘而不可能达到的顶峰，你可以瞄准与一千名真正粉丝的直接联系。在这条道路上，无论你真正成功地获得了多少粉丝，你的周围都将不再是浮躁的迷恋，而是真心实意的欣赏。这是一种更为理智的命运期许。你也更有可能真正到达那里。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsw1xa2929kxt47608wts6sg))
