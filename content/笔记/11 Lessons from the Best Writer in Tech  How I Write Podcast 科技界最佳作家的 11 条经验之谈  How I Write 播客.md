## Highlights
- And PG says that one of the biggest things that holds writers back and actually anybody in general that holds people back from doing great work is the fear of making something lame. Most projects look lame at the beginning. 
  而 PG 说，阻碍作家和一般人完成伟大作品的最大原因之一，就是害怕做出蹩脚的作品。大多数项目在开始时都显得很蹩脚。

  And if you're going to write, if you're going to be successful in any endeavor, you have to get comfortable with the ugliness, the messiness, the sludge of an idea in its early stages. And then you just got to push through. 
  如果你要写作，如果你要在任何工作中取得成功，你就必须适应丑陋、混乱、污泥般的想法的早期阶段。然后你就得坚持下去 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hw52ns66r2r0je1wyc1ecfg9))
- And what you could do is you can just change the frame of how you're thinking about this creation. Where in the world of painting, you're not making a painting, you're working on a sketch. 
  你可以做的就是改变你思考创作的框架。在绘画世界里，你不是在作画，而是在画草图。
  15:42
  In the world of software, you're not making some grand piece of software, you're just sort of hacking around. You're not working on an essay, you're just writing a letter to friends. Hey, maybe you're texting friends. 
  在软件的世界里，你并不是在制作什么伟大的软件，你只是在四处黑客。你不是在写文章，你只是在给朋友写信。嘿，也许你在给朋友发短信。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hw52peayymcjjpbz16es5mg9))
- You got to get to a point where you can just have a lower standard for the initial things you create. And I know that that's counterintuitive, but sometimes that low standard It actually helps you be creative, 
  你必须达到这样一种境界，即你可以对最初的创作降低标准。我知道这有违直觉，但有时低标准实际上有助于你发挥创造力、

  get stuff onto the page, get stuff going, and then yeah, once the project's rolling, sure, just convert it into something more. It reminds me of a few years ago in our second Write of Passage cohort. 
  把东西写在纸上，把东西写下去，然后，一旦项目启动，当然，就把它转换成更多的东西。这让我想起了几年前我们的第二届 "写作之旅"。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hw52pwd47ffaajw7k4m1pc14))
- She could write well on emails, but she freaks herself out whenever she writes for public consumption. And that's why PG says you got to focus on the editing. Great writing comes from great editing. 
  她在邮件里写得很好，但每次在公开场合写作时，她都会把自己吓坏。这就是为什么 PG 说你必须把重点放在编辑上。好的文章来自好的编辑。
  17:59
  And if you can lower the stakes in the early versions of a project, you're going to be better off. So then the question is, all right, well, how do you edit? Well, I do know one thing. 
  如果你能在项目的早期版本中降低赌注，你就能获得更好的效果。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hw7jj0xrw70wbfjyff1z13mh))
- I do know that he prints things out instead of editing on the computer. And I've done this a few times. If you plan to do that, here are some tricks that I've discovered. 
  我知道他把东西打印出来，而不是在电脑上编辑。我也这么做过几次。如果你打算这么做，这里有一些我发现的小窍门。
  18:21
  One is, so you print it out, you got the piece of paper, you're reading, just grab a highlighter and highlight every section where you feel stuck or frustrated. You're almost thinking of like, imagine a flat surface. 
  一个是，你把它打印出来，你拿到了纸，你正在阅读，就拿起荧光笔，把你感到卡住或沮丧的每一部分都标出来。你几乎是在想，想象一个平面。
  18:33
  Imagine every place where you just have some bump in the road, okay? And just highlight it. You don't need to fix it. Just that simple. Just highlight it. Get stuck, make a highlight. And read through the entire piece. Just go start to finish. 
  想象一下你在路上遇到的每一个地方，好吗？把它突出来。你不需要修复它。就这么简单。只是突出它。卡住了，做一个亮点。然后通读全文。从头到尾。
  18:45
  Stop only to make highlights. Be really quick. Zing, clip, zing, clip, just little thing. And then take that and then go through the highlights on the computer and then that's when you do the fixing. 
  只在突出重点时才停下来。一定要快咔嚓，咔嚓，咔嚓，咔嚓，就这些小动作。然后在电脑上查看高光部分，然后再进行修整。
  18:57
  So the consumption of what you're editing and the fixing of what you're editing, they happen at different times. See, the problem with editing Trying to make all the fixes in the moment is sometimes you get really distracted. 
  因此，编辑时的消耗和编辑时的修正是在不同时间发生的。你看，编辑的问题就在于试图在当下完成所有修正，有时你真的会分心。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hw7jjw5b4phzxwkpkbepn8dh))
- You'll notice that if you scroll to the bottom of PG's essays, you'll see all these names, Patrick Collison, Sam Altman, Robert Morris, Jessica Livingston, his wife, and these are people who have helped him work on the piece. 
  你会注意到，如果你把 PG 的文章滚动到底部，你会看到所有这些名字，帕特里克-科里森、萨姆-奥特曼、罗伯特-莫里斯、杰西卡-利文斯顿、他的妻子，这些都是帮助他完成作品的人。
  19:53
  So what does he do when he asks for help? He does two things. There's two things that he wants to know from his readers. Number one, what parts bore them? Number two, what parts seem unconvincing? What parts seem unconvincing? 
  那么，当他寻求帮助时，他会怎么做呢？他做了两件事。他想从读者那里知道两件事。第一，哪些地方让他们感到厌烦？第二，哪些地方看起来没有说服力？哪些地方难以令人信服？ ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hw7astk84h8k7wh2bbmpxqm0))
- the questions that people ask Show me what parts of what I'm saying aren't all that clear and then my answers help me to clarify what's going on. Because the thing is, this is the curse of knowledge, that once you know an idea fairly well, 
  人们提出的问题让我知道，我在说什么，有哪些地方说得不是很清楚，然后我的回答会帮助我澄清到底发生了什么。因为问题是，这就是知识的诅咒，一旦你对一个观点相当了解，你就会发现，你的知识是多么的有限、
  20:57
  it's hard to remember what parts are obvious and intuitive and what parts aren't going to be easily understandable to the average person. Another tip, and I learned this from Tim Ferriss on an episode of How I Write, 
  你很难记住哪些部分是显而易见的、直观的，哪些部分是普通人不容易理解的。还有一个小窍门，这是我从蒂姆-费里斯（Tim Ferriss）在《我如何写作》（How I Write）一集中学到的、
  21:14
  where what he does when he asks for friends is he says, what is the 10% I need to keep no matter what? And then what is the 10% I'll cut if I absolutely had to cut it? 
  当他向朋友们征求意见时，他会说："无论如何，我需要保留的 10%是什么？然后，如果万不得已，我会砍掉哪 10%？
  21:27
  Talking to friends and asking for what is the 10% that you would cut, I think that's a good piece of advice. 
  和朋友们聊聊，问问他们你会砍掉哪 10%，我觉得这是个很好的建议。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hw7cqc0hzrpqkjkxf1x8ty2h))

- Doesn't rewrite the whole thing, but rereads his essays 50 times. And he says, good writing is rewriting. Good design is redesign. It's actually rare that you get things right the first time. For me, I hear that. 
  他没有重写，而是把文章重读了 50 遍。他说，好的写作是重写。好的设计是重新设计。第一次就把事情做对的情况其实很少见。对我来说，我听到了这句话。
  23:39
  I just go, oh, that's such a relief. It's such a relief that I don't have to be perfect the first time. 
  我就会想，哦，这真是一种解脱。我不必在第一次就做到完美，这让我松了一口气。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hw7jskpr0wn2rrkg32e6gz0n))
- I learned this in the research for this episode that PG writes that the distinctive back of the Porsche 911, that famous car, it only came out of a redesign from an awkward prototype. How cool is that? How cool is that? 
  我在研究这一集时了解到，PG 写道，保时捷 911 这款著名汽车的独特背部，是在笨拙的原型基础上重新设计而成的。这有多酷？有多酷？
  24:33
  And that's how PG's think about writing. That often when you're redesigning, you're rewriting, that's when you find things you would have never found without writing. 
  PG就是这样看待写作的。当你重新设计、重新撰写时，你往往会发现一些不通过写作永远也发现不了的东西。
  24:43
  The process of refinement isn't just about removal, it is inherently creative and you just discover things from the problems that inevitably emerge. Which takes me to lesson number three, that writing generates ideas. 
  完善的过程不仅仅是删除，它本身就具有创造性，你只是从不可避免地出现的问题中发现了一些东西。这让我想到了第三课，即写作能产生创意。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hw7jtdpekfrqw026tsj56z9x))
- Half the ideas that end up in an essay will be ones that you thought of while you were writing it. Indeed, That's why I write essays, to find the ideas that I can only find by writing. 
  文章中一半的观点都是你在写作时想到的。的确，这也是我写作文的原因，因为只有通过写作才能找到灵感。
  25:31
  And that means that the problem with not writing is that you're missing out on the ideas that writing would have generated. 
  这意味着，不写作的问题在于，你错过了写作会产生的想法。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hw7jw6y9ge26nyteh1mba067))
- All those things that you're going to get by writing, that you're going to get by focus, if you do not sit down to the keyboard, you're never going to find those ideas. 
  如果你不坐下来敲打键盘，你就永远找不到这些想法。
  25:47
  And the great misconception of writing is that people who write something brilliant, they just wake up every morning, they have all the ideas in their head, 
  写作的最大误区在于，那些能写出杰出作品的人，每天早上醒来，脑子里就有了所有的想法、 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hw7jwp34ceqqe4br4a1fsa1x))
- What kinds of ideas should we be looking for? Well, that brings me to lesson number four. Find ideas that are general and surprising. Those are the most valuable ones, general and surprising. That's like the holy grail for PG. 
  我们应该寻找什么样的想法？这就是第四课。寻找一般性的、出人意料的想法。这是最有价值的创意，既概括又出人意料。这就像是 PG 的圣杯。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hw7k2237bk4wm05c63ddsvar))
