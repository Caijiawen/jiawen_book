  I've noticed that like whenever you get stuff on paper, like when it's in your head, it's all amorphous and it just kind of consumes you. And then like you said, you had that experience when you were going through your withdrawals, you put all those thoughts on a screen and it makes it concrete and you're able to see it's like, Oh, actually, that's not that. I mean, some of those issues are big, but it's not as big as my brain is fooling me to think it.
  Speaker 1
  Massively. And that's it. And it's almost like a cavernous echo effects that it has when it is in your head. And then once it's on the page, it kind of looks a bit like dormant or benign and you're like, Well, hello, little thought. I can see you there.
  Speaker 2
  Well, let's talk about some specific journaling practices that have changed your life because you've developed other ones after you did the initial just like her brain dump that sort of put you on this path that you started figuring other ways other practices or techniques you can use. But before we talk about those, I want to talk more about this brain dump you did when you were at your grandparents house. Because this is a practice you've continued to use since then. And this is a practice that anyone can use. It's really easy to do. You make the case this is how we can declutter our minds and our, you know, slash houseboat and free up some brain space. So tell us more about, you know, what this journaling practice looks like.
  Speaker 1
  Basically, no inhibitions just type every single thought or write every single thought. Or if you aren't able to type or write, use voice like a voice recording up, but just get everything out of your head and flush it onto somewhere else. There is no structure intentionally. And I guess the idea is it doesn't matter how small or insignificant the thought seems, just get it out and try chase your thoughts out and get them onto the page. So even if your thought is something like, Man, I really doubt that that Australian guy knows what he's talking about or like, Man, this whole journaling thing. Is it really what it's cracked up to be? I am not feeling the full effects of this. Where's my euphoria? Get that out. You know what I mean? And then once you do, it opens up the next layer. And that next layer might be, Oh, I was meant to buy so-and-so birthday present. Oh, it's nearly the end of the year. And I haven't even thought about what I'm doing for Christmas. Oh, it's going to be 2023. And how am I going to make my life different? And oh my God, I didn't even do all those new years resolutions. Oh God, I'm such a failure. Oh, is my dad's fault? You know what I mean? You just kind of like peel back the layers and it all just comes out. And there it is, granted it's unstructured, but that's where the techniques come in, right?
  Speaker 2
  Yeah, it puts like a lot of less, there's like no pressure, right? Sometimes I think people when they start journaling, they put this pressure as well, it's got to sound good because they read journals from like their great, great grandparent, where it sounds like very sophisticated and it's like, no, it doesn't need to be like that. Just go stream of conscious. That's all you got to do. ([TimeÂ 0:09:05](https://share.snipd.com/snip/7530f6f5-a3f7-471c-80ac-1e24e734013c))
