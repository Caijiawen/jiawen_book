## Highlights
- Boost Your Brain w/ Nutrition
  Key takeaways:
  - Eating healthy foods and getting enough sleep are essential for optimizing brain performance.
  - Intermittent fasting can be a helpful way to improve brain function, but it is not the only way.
  - Proper intermittent fasting involves restricting calories to 500 or 600 per day for two days of the week, and eating normally the other days.

  Speaker 4
  So I think there's a lot of things that are in the public domain that people are aware of that we all know we should be doing, but we're not necessarily always doing. But there are definitely fun neuroscience facts that I can throw in that I guess maybe even you haven't heard of. So, should we try? Yeah, perfect. Yeah. Okay. So I would say like level one is that you eat three healthy meals a day and maybe you snack in between if you need to. And when I say healthy, mostly plant based, you know, maybe some fish and eggs, minimal amounts of other types of meat, foods that contain high amounts of water and good fats. So a bit of dairy, fatty fish, nuts and seeds, berries. I mean, I'm already going above level one, I would say with some of those, but you know, three healthy meals a day.
  Speaker 9
  That kind of question on that front. Yeah. Intimidant fasting.
  Speaker 4
  Yeah. Yeah. So level two. Oh, that's okay. If you're not eating healthily generally. Yeah. You're not sleeping around seven to eight hours, fifteen a night, drinking enough water, making sure you're not sedentary. Don't bother with intermittent fasting. You need to have those foundations. Correct. If you're doing all that good stuff and maybe even meditating, then you can take it to the next level, which is the first level would be time restricted eating. So, for example, I only eat between 12 noon and 8pm. So I'm essentially doing a 16 hour fast overnight, which has all sorts of benefits on longevity and cancer risk reduction. And once you get used to it, it's also, it's also good for your mental performance. The third level, which I'm considering doing again, the rest of this year, but I haven't quite got there yet is what I think is proper intermittent fasting, which is that for two days of the week, you reduce your calorie intake to for women 500 calories and for men 600 calories a day. And the other days of the week you eat normally. But in all three of those stages, you still have to be eating the kinds of foods that I mentioned. And so this is, tell me whether you knew this or not. But in terms of brain optimization, eating dark skinned foods is much better than just eating general, you know, the leafy greens or the salads. Dark skinned. Yeah. So, blueberries rather than strawberries or raspberries. Purple sprouting broccoli rather than green broccoli, black beans and black chickpeas rather than cannellini beans or normal chickpeas.
  Speaker 1
  Why, why is that? I had no idea.
  Speaker 4
  So the skin and things like eggplant as well. Think the, the, in the skin of darker foods, and actually you'll like this because it does include good quality coffee and dark chocolate that's over 80% cocoa. And there are substances called anthocyanins that are really powerful antioxidants, and they contribute to something called neurogenesis. So there's three ways of growing your brain, if you like. And I, and I use that in a, as a metaphor. And the hardest one in adults is for embryonic nerve cells to actually grow into neurons and connect up with other neurons in your brain. And so aerobic exercise and foods that contain high levels of anthocyanins can contribute to neurogenesis.
  Speaker 1
  Oh, going for a run is good.
  Speaker 4
  Going for a run is good. If you're feeling guilty because you haven't been going for a run, then when you do regular aerobic exercise, the cell turnover is sort of 13, 14% of neurogenesis. If you have, haven't been doing exercise for some time and you start again, it can actually be up to 30%. So to me, that's the perfect excuse for every time I fall off my schedule of exercise and I start again that I'm really boosting my neurogenesis. But, you know, I'm never sedentary, but I'm not always doing like full on aerobic, sort of more high intensity exercise. So, yeah.
  Speaker 1
  So one mechanism is neurogenesis, the one that makes our brain quite grow.
  Speaker 4
  What are the other two? So neurogenesis is the embryonic cells growing into new neurons. The next one is synapto connection, which is already existing neurons connecting up with each other to make stronger pathways. And the third one, which you'll be well aware of is myelination, which is a fatty substance that coats some pathways in the brain and body. And there's a reason that so, and that leads to faster conduction of electrical signals along those pathways. And there are reasons that we have some pathways that are myelinated and some that aren't. Like, for example, if you put your hand in a fire, your reflex to snatch your hand out of the fire is a fast myelinated pathway. But your pain pathways are non-myelinated, because if you were incapacitated by the pain of burning your hand, you wouldn't be able to move or escape from the, you know, the threat kind of thing. But what in terms of what we're talking about, which is brain performance, basically repetition can lead to more myelination, which means that that pathway becomes a faster conducting pathway for you. So something like resisting the urge to eat junk food. Like there's some crisps over there.
  Speaker 1
  And last night, I made the bad choice to eat the crisps and Gordon kind of looked at me and like side, I was like, whoa, there's 200 calories in these. And today I didn't. I decided to eat the chips as they were.
  Speaker 4
  Well, that could be to do with time of day, because your willpower also reduces during the day. Yeah, maybe. But I mean, for me, it's mostly about stimulus control, which is that I don't keep those things.
  Speaker 1
  Yeah. It's a, yeah, it's a lot easier to resist the chocolate cake if it's not there. Okay. So we've got neurogenesis from embryonic cells. We've got the synaptic connections and we've got myelination.
  Speaker 10
  Yeah. How such a pleasure talking to you, because most people are like, what were those things again? ([TimeÂ 0:05:08](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ddf68fd5-2efe-47bf-a748-2b4234ce7605))
