- And what happened was he would struggle and he would struggle and he eventually said, I'm just going to write two crappy pages per day. That's all I'm going to do. Two crappy pages. And it's just two. 
  结果他挣扎了又挣扎，最后他说，我只想每天写两页蹩脚的东西。这就是我要做的。两页蹩脚的文章就两页
  02:55
  Everyone can write two pages per day, but even more, he said, they're going to be two pages and they're going to be crappy. That's it. That is all I need to focus on, but I'm going to do it every single day. 
  他说，每个人每天都可以写两页纸，但再多也是两页纸，而且会很蹩脚。就是这样。这就是我需要关注的，但我每天都要这么做。
  03:04
  Then by doing it day in and day out, day in and day out, a book hopefully will come out of him. So we focused on that. Day by day shipping, day by day shipping. And I got to say, I noticed the same thing. 
  然后通过日复一日的努力，希望他能写出一本书。所以我们把重点放在这上面。日复一日地发货，日复一日地发货。我得说，我也注意到了这一点。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxej10kttmtn4bkxd0rvmtdf))
- Actually, sometimes they don't even let themselves think the honest truth because they like you. But what he does is he says, hey, tell me this, what's the 20% that I should keep no matter what? 
  事实上，有时他们甚至不会让自己去想真实的真相，因为他们喜欢你。但他的做法是，他说，嘿，告诉我，无论如何我都应该保留的那 20%是什么？
  06:47
  What is the 20% that should stay in that is worthy of being in there? And then that gives them the chance to compliment you, right? And then on the other side, he says, if I had to cut 20%, had to cut it, what 20% should that be? 
  哪些是值得保留的 20%？这样他们就有机会称赞你了，对吗？然后在另一方面，他说，如果我不得不削减 20%，不得不削减，那 20%应该是多少？
  07:04
  And what is he doing here? Psychologically, he is giving his editor an easy way for an editor friend to give you harsh feedback if they're scared of offending you because they have to say, 
  他在这里做什么呢？从心理学角度讲，他是在给编辑提供一个简便的方法，让编辑朋友在害怕得罪你的情况下给你严厉的反馈，因为他们不得不说、 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxej2w5dmaqn357xcp6pbv9y))
- The next is number two, Kevin Kelly, who wrote Excellent Advice for Living, which is a book of maxims. And my favorite one is don't aim to be the best, be the only. 
  第二位是凯文-凯利（Kevin Kelly），他写了《给生活的绝妙建议》（Excellent Advice for Living），这是一本格言集。我最喜欢的一句是：不要追求最好，要追求唯一。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxej3d465appw5tfzkxw0p98))
- This is who he is and I think you'll really enjoy it. You walk in and he basically has built this separate house next to his house and it is just a multi-story celebration of his passions. 
  这就是他，我想你会非常喜欢的。你走进去，就会发现他基本上是在自己的房子旁边单独建了一栋房子，而这栋房子就是他激情的多层庆祝活动。
  12:56
  Obviously there's things around technology, computers and books. Oh my goodness. The bookshelf is like eight bookshelf stories high and it's probably 50 feet from floor to ceiling. 
  当然还有科技、电脑和书籍。我的天啊书架有八层楼那么高，从地板到天花板大概有 50 英尺。
  13:09
  And there are thousands and thousands of books that he's been collecting for years and it's all categorized by different Kevin Kelly interests. But then there's all these other things. Like I didn't realize he was so into biology. 
  他多年来收集了成千上万的书籍 这些书都是按照凯文-凯利的不同兴趣分类的还有很多其他的东西比如我没想到他对生物学这么感兴趣
  13:20
  I knew that he was really interested in Asia. He spent a bunch of time showing us his photos. 
  我知道他对亚洲真的很感兴趣。他花了很多时间给我们看他的照片。
  13:25
  Because he's basically been everywhere in Asia all these things that he's building by hand all these things that he collects like these this this like taxidermy bird and then these bones that he collected from From this animal that was outside. 
  因为他基本上走遍了亚洲 所有这些东西都是他亲手制作的 所有这些东西都是他收集的 比如这些鸟类标本 还有这些骨头都是他从外面的动物身上收集的
  13:38
  It was like what is going on? And you can just see this guy gets really obsessed with things, sort of the synthesis of the natural world and technology, 
  就像发生了什么事？你可以看到这家伙对各种事物非常着迷，就像是自然世界和科技的结合体、
  13:52
  they fuse and he's very much into the sort of cosmic scale of blending past and especially future. And you can see it in physical space. 
  他们融合在一起，他非常喜欢把过去和未来融合在一起的那种宇宙尺度。你可以在物理空间中看到这一点。
  14:03
  And it's the kind of space that only Kevin Kelly could have built, which got me thinking to He's the kind of writer that's trying to write the kinds of pieces that only he can write. 
  这是只有凯文-凯利才能打造的空间，这让我想到，他是那种试图写出只有他才能写出的作品的作家。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxej8v01d3e090b48fqsgq7y))
- I think I needed to get something like a book that I had given him and he had this stack of books next to his bed and I didn't recognize any of them. And there were people like John Ruskin and Plutarch and all these old books, 
  我想我需要找些东西，比如我给他的书，他床边有一摞书，我一本都不认识。里面有约翰-罗斯金、普鲁塔克等人的书 还有这些旧书
  22:55
  there were many hundreds of And it was funny, even one night at dinner, we were saying grace and he just pulled out this poem from memory, probably took him two, three minutes to recite. 
  有趣的是，有一天晚上吃饭的时候，我们正在祷告，他凭着记忆念出了一首诗，大概花了两三分钟就背完了。
  23:05
  And it was like, oh yeah, that's from like 1874. What I like about him is there's such congruence between what he writes about and who he is. They're the same person. They're the same person. He just doesn't read much new stuff at all. 
  然后我就想，哦，对了，那是1874年的作品。我喜欢他的地方在于，他写的东西和他的为人是一致的。他们是同一个人。是同一个人他只是不怎么读新东西而已
  23:19
  You ask him about pop culture, he has no idea what you're talking about. You ask him about the latest book, he has no idea what you're talking about. 
  你问他流行文化，他不知道你在说什么。你问他最新的书，他也不知道你在说什么。
  23:25
  But you ask him about history, you ask him about ancient architecture, you ask him about the Greeks and the Romans and poetry that's 400 years old, Shakespeare, he'll have a heck of a lot to say. And that then fuses into his writing. 
  但如果你问他历史，问他古建筑，问他希腊人、罗马人，问他 400 年前的诗歌、莎士比亚，他就会有很多话要说。这些都会融入他的写作中。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxeje6yr51nt7hw69hah2rn3))
- My general method is to try to barbell my information intake. So it's either stuff that is super current or it's stuff that's timeless. 
  我的一般方法是尝试用 "杠铃 "来摄取信息。因此，要么是超前的东西，要么是永恒的东西。
  25:18
  And so what I'm trying to do is not read, basically not trying, I'm trying to not read anything that's from yesterday through to like 10 years ago. I'm trying to like screen all that stuff out. 
  所以我想做的就是不读，基本上是不读，我想不读从昨天到十年前的任何东西。我想把那些东西都屏蔽掉
  25:27
  And it's, I'm trying to be super current and the form of being super current is talking to people who are currently experts or it's, or it's specifically Twitter, right? 
  而且，我正努力做到与时俱进，而与时俱进的形式就是与目前的专家或推特上的人交谈，对吗？ ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxejfe9dp3js2599hgr05hbt))
- And what writing is, is that writing is vertical whereas thinking is horizontal. So this is what came from this and I'll tell you what I mean by that. Start with thinking is horizontal and then I'll go into why writing is vertical. 
  写作是纵向的，而思考是横向的。所以这就是我的结论，我会告诉你我的意思。先说思维是横向的，然后我再讲为什么写作是纵向的。
  48:03
  So I noticed this when I meditate. Close my eyes. I sit there and what does my mind do? It hops from one idea to the next idea to the next idea to the next idea and it's sort of skipping along the lily pads because the mind likes to wander. 
  因此，我在冥想时注意到了这一点。闭上眼睛。我坐在那里，我的大脑在做什么？它从一个念头跳到下一个念头，又从下一个念头跳到下一个念头，就像在百合花丛中跳来跳去，因为思绪喜欢游荡。
  48:21
  It'll constantly skip around, it'll change topics, but it'll never really go that deep into a specific topic. It kind of stays surface level. 
  它会不断地跳来跳去，会变换话题，但绝不会真正深入到某个特定的话题。它只是停留在表面。
  48:32
  Whereas writing is much more vertical, what I think that you're doing when you commit to writing about something, when you commit to focusing on a single topic is you're basically chaining yourself to the pillar of that idea. 
  而写作则更加垂直，我认为当你致力于写某件事情时，当你致力于专注于一个话题时，你所做的基本上就是把自己拴在这个想法的支柱上。
  48:44
  And because you can't go sideways and horizontally, you have to go down vertically. You focus on a single topic. Minute after minute. Hour after hour. Day by day. And it's arduous because your brain doesn't want to do that. 
  因为无法横向发展，所以只能纵向发展。你专注于一个话题。一分钟又一分钟一小时又一小时。一天又一天这很困难，因为你的大脑不想这样做。
  49:01
  It's actually not natural and that's why writing is so good for you. But what it does is it forces you to resist the brain's natural impulse to skip between topics. 
  这其实是不自然的，这就是为什么写作对你如此有益。但它的作用是迫使你抵制大脑跳过不同主题的自然冲动。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxejscpzpabvkqgbqb9hp25f))
- The podcast that inspired me the most in building How I Write is Invest Like the Best. 
  在创建 "我如何写作 "的过程中，给我启发最大的播客是 "像最优秀的人一样投资"。
  51:29
  What I admire from Patrick is how he has continued to hold the quality bar so high for that show, has built an unbelievable network and reputation from the podcast that he has run. 
  我钦佩帕特里克的地方在于，他一直将节目质量保持在很高的水准上，并通过自己运营的播客建立了一个令人难以置信的网络和声誉。
  51:43
  He clearly loves it, loves asking questions, gets to meet such cool people. But also he's been able to use that platform to launch the careers of a lot of other investors. 
  他显然很喜欢这个平台，喜欢问问题，能结识很多很酷的人。此外，他还利用这个平台，让很多其他投资者开始了自己的职业生涯。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxejtkqdnrwgwyh70b03dkzk))
- And then by being the author, the founder, the pioneer, you necessarily become a leader. Marc Andreessen is an example of an archigos. 
  然后，作为作者、创始人和先驱者，你必然会成为领导者。马克-安德森（Marc Andreessen）就是 "领袖 "的典范。
  56:39
  Where he recruits people on Twitter, he writes things like his literal manifesto that he talked about on our podcast. Then by writing, he is building this new firm and is the leader. Writing is how he gets his ideas out there. 
  他在推特上招募员工，写一些东西，比如他在播客中提到的 "宣言"。通过写作，他建立了这家新公司，并成为领导者。写作是他将想法传播出去的方式。
  56:57
  Another example, and this is one more historically, this is my favorite example of an archigos is think of America's founding fathers. They write the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence really early on. 
  另一个更具历史意义的例子是美国的开国元勋们。他们很早就写出了《宪法》和《独立宣言》。
  57:08
  This group of hyperliterate scholars, Thomas Jefferson, Ben Franklin, they go on to found this new country. They pioneered new ways of thinking about governance and democracy. 
  托马斯-杰斐逊、本-富兰克林等这群博学多才的学者建立了这个新国家。他们开创了治理和民主的新思路。
  57:18
  Then Jefferson, George Washington, they become the leaders of the United States. And I believe that all of that begins with this concept of a core idea. 
  然后，杰斐逊、乔治-华盛顿，他们成为了美国的领导人。我认为，所有这一切都始于核心理念这一概念。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxejwjday6nb4xvkfy9edbrb))
