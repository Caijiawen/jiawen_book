## Highlights
- And we help entrepreneurs raise money. We help entrepreneurs recruit talent into their startups and we also help people find jobs into startups and now recently required co product hunts. So we also help companies launch the customers. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv8ebb2wr49yre0k1r5x8j4s))
- So it's basically a one stop shop for the early stage tech with ecosystem, whether you're raising money or you're investing money with the largest online platform for that, whether you're recruiting talent or whether you're being recruited with the largest online platform for startup recruiting.

- If there is a typical day, I'm usually inside my office at Angel List, but I'm basically just operating mostly on email or phone or meetings or squirreled up at home. So there days where I just work completely from home. 
  如果说典型的一天，我通常会在天使名单的办公室里，但我基本上只是通过电子邮件、电话、会议或在家里工作。所以有些时候，我完全在家工作。
  04:07
  Their days that I don't work, I'm actually even trying to get rid of this concept of having to be the specific play to the specific time all I care about is am I doing what I want to do and I being productive and am I happy? 
  在我不工作的日子里，我甚至试图摆脱这种概念，即必须在特定的时间做特定的事情，我所关心的是我是否在做我想做的事情，我是否富有成效，我是否快乐？
  04:21
  And I really want to break away from this idea of 40 hour weeks or 60 hour weeks or 80 hour weeks or 9 to 5 or roles or jobs or identity. These, it just all feels like a straight. 
  我真的很想摆脱这种每周40小时、60小时、80小时、朝九晚五、角色、工作或身份的观念。这些，都让人觉得是一种直觉。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv8ees9cqvbqc7qz0rjzsxx8))
- The reality is I just read a lot that by today's standards would be considered mental junk food. 
  现实情况是，我只是读了很多以今天的标准来看属于精神垃圾食品的书。
  06:15
  But eventually you just get to reading, you run out of the junk food and then you start eating the healthy food, right, or your taste kind of graduate. 
  但最终你会发现，垃圾食品吃完了，你就会开始吃健康食品，对吧，或者你的口味也会随之改变。
  06:24
  So I think to some extent that's what happened with me because I started from comic books and then run from that into mysteries and went from that into fantasy, then into SCI fi and then from SCI fi made into science and then mathematics and then philosophy be so it just kind of kept climbing up the stack. 
  因此，我认为在某种程度上这就是我的情况，因为我从漫画书开始，然后从漫画书进入推理小说，再从推理小说进入奇幻小说，然后进入科幻小说，再从科幻小说进入科学，然后是数学，然后是哲学，就这样一直往上爬。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv8ejes8nnzfbjs4dty5p0ww))
- And this is even back when I was broken I had no money. I I always spend money on books. 
  甚至在我崩溃的时候，我也没有钱。我总是花钱买书。
  07:18
  I never view that as an expense that's an investment to me and I probably spend 10 times as much money and books as I actually get through in other words, like for every $200 worth of books I buy actually end up making it through 10% so I'll read $20 worth of books, but it's still absolutely worth it. 
  我从不认为那是一种花费，对我来说那是一种投资，我花的钱和花的书可能是我实际读完的10倍，换句话说，就像我买的每本价值200美元的书，我最终读完了10%，所以我读了价值20美元的书，但这仍然是绝对值得的。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv8ekr45zvj5jhevgx5rm2bn))
- And anything that's one of the greats. Like if I read a book and I know that it's amazing, I'll buy multiple copies, partially the giveaway, partially cuz I have them lying around the house. 
  还有任何伟大的书。比如，如果我读了一本书，知道它非常棒，我就会买多本，一方面是为了赠送，另一方面是因为我家里就有这些书。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv8en8syq6914j3gk21bqqec))
- I, I recently reread the lessons of history by William Ariel Durant. It's a great little book, history book. I am. I'm currently reading story of philosophy, also by Will. 
  我最近重读了威廉-阿里尔-杜兰特写的《历史的教训》。这是一本很棒的小书，历史书。是的我正在读《哲学的故事》 也是威尔写的 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv8ewfg3cybm8cqmw08102nt))
- When I'm on vacation, I'll read. But if I'm sitting in a lift or an Uber, I'll read. Sometimes in the morning at home, after I worked out, I'll just read. Sometimes when I wake up, I'll just grab my phone and read it. 
  当我度假时，我会读书。但如果我坐在电梯里或 Uber 上，我也会看书。有时早上在家里，锻炼完之后，我就会看书。有时一觉醒来，我就拿起手机看书。
  11:37
  I just, I, I don't set, I'm not a very disciplined person, so I don't really set these hard and fast rules for myself because I'm, but the good news, I just love to read because I love to. 
  我只是，我，我没有设定，我不是一个非常有纪律的人，所以我真的没有为自己设定这些硬性规定，因为我，但好消息是，我只是喜欢阅读，因为我喜欢。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv8exr3h3vbt91qzj2afh3et))
- So now I treat books the same way, which is I'll skim through a large number of books, I'll put them down, I'll jump around, back, forward, middle until I find a part that's interesting. 
  因此，现在我对待书籍的方式也是一样的，那就是我会略读大量书籍，我会放下它们，我会跳来跳去，后退、前进、中间，直到找到我感兴趣的部分。
  14:34
  Then I'll just consume that piece and I won't feel guilty about having to finish the entire book. Because they just view it as a blog archive, right? 
  这样，我就可以把那篇文章读完，也就不会因为必须读完整本书而感到内疚了。因为他们只是把它当作博客存档，对吗？
  14:41
  It's a like a blog might have 300 posts on it and you can read just the 2,3,5 that you need right now. And I think you can think of a book the same way. And then that opens the world and web of books back open to us. 
  就像一个博客可能有 300 篇文章，而你现在只需要读其中的 2、3、5 篇。我想你也可以用同样的方式来看待一本书。这样，书的世界和网络就又向我们敞开了。
  14:52
  And instead of it being buried somewhere, I think like many people, I know of a lot of friends who are currently stuck on a book somewhere. And if you ask people if they read, everybody says they read. Everybody says they're reading a book. 
  而不是埋没在某个地方，我想和很多人一样，我认识的很多朋友现在都在某个地方埋头看书。如果你问人们是否阅读，每个人都说他们阅读。每个人都说自己在看书。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv8f5pxz2gd626t62mkjb09g))
- So the people who are obsessing over like, should I be weight training or should I be doing tennis or should I be doing Pilates or should I be doing the high intensity training method versus the happy body versus whatever, they're missing the point. 
  因此，那些纠结于 "我应该进行负重训练还是应该打网球""我应该进行普拉提训练还是应该进行高强度训练""我应该进行快乐身体训练还是应该进行其他训练 "等问题的人，根本就没有抓住重点。
  16:20
  The important thing is to do something every day. It doesn't matter what it is. So the same way I would argue the important thing is to read every day. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv8fd65qp0w230weahddvfyp))
- It almost doesn't matter what you read cuz eventually you'll read enough things and your interest will lead you there that will dramatically improve your life. 
  读什么书几乎并不重要，因为最终你会读到足够多的东西，你的兴趣会引导你去读那些能极大改善你生活的书。
  16:36
  So just like the best workout for you is the one that you're excited enough to do every day. 
  所以，就像最适合你的锻炼方式就是你每天都能兴奋地去做的锻炼方式一样。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv8fdhbftxw3z444xagraanr))
- To some extent, our attitude in life, our mood, our happiness levels, depression levels, these are also habits. Do we judge people? How often do we eat? What kind of food do we eat? Do we walk or do we sit? Do we move? Do we exercise? Do we read? 
  在某种程度上，我们的生活态度、我们的心情、我们的快乐程度、抑郁程度，这些也都是习惯。我们会评判别人吗？我们多久吃一次饭？吃什么样的食物？我们是走路还是坐着？我们动吗？我们运动吗？我们读书吗？ ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv8fjden1p0q6b4pwacj086j))
- And it's really important to be able to uncondition yourself, to be able to take your habits apart and say, oh, okay, well that's that's a habit that I probably picked up from when I was a toddler and I was trying to get my parent's attention and now I'm just reinforced it and reinforced and reinforced it and I call it part of my identity but is it serving me anymore? 
  重要的是，要能够解除自己的条件限制，能够将自己的习惯拆解开来，然后说："哦，好吧，这可能是我蹒跚学步时养成的习惯，当时我想引起父母的注意，现在我只是将它强化了又强化，强化了又强化，我称它为我身份的一部分，但它对我有用吗？
  18:37
  Is it making me happier? Is it making me healthier? Is it making me accomplish whatever I wanna set up to accomplish right now? 
  它是否让我更快乐？是否让我更健康？是否让我完成了我现在想要完成的任务？ ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv8fkeewb9977gg1j5rebwy9))
- I think it's the daily morning workout that has been a complete game changer. It's made me feel healthier, younger. It's maybe not go out late. And it came from one simple thing, which is everybody says I don't have time, right? 
  我认为每天的晨练彻底改变了我的生活。它让我感觉更健康、更年轻。也许我不会出去玩到很晚。这源于一件简单的事情，那就是每个人都说我没时间，对吧？
  27:15
  Basically whenever you throw any so called good habit at somebody, they'll have an excuse for themselves. And usually the most common is I don't have time and I don't have time. It's just another way of saying it's not a priority. 
  基本上，只要你把所谓的好习惯抛给别人，他们就会给自己找借口。通常最常见的借口就是我没有时间，我没有时间。这只是说它不是优先事项的另一种方式。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv8ftj6p7xgg3nt2fnfeqggy))
- So what I did there was I basically just said, my No. 1 priority in life, above my happiness, above my family, above my work, is my own health. And it starts with my physical health. And then second is my mental health. 
  所以，我在那里所做的，基本上就是说，我生命中的第一要务，高于我的幸福，高于我的家庭，高于我的工作，就是我自己的健康。首先是我的身体健康。其次是心理健康。
  27:57
  And then third is my spiritual health, and then is my family's health, then is my family's well being. And then after that, I can go out and do whatever I need to do the rest of the world. 
  第三是我的精神健康，然后是我的家人健康，然后是我的家人幸福。之后，我就可以出去做我需要做的其他事情了。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv8fv014aznkhz2eyg6nrevr))
- So if I see anybody who's even around me, let's say I'm doing business with somebody and they think in a short term manner with somebody else, then I don't wanna do business with that person anymore because I think all the benefits on live come from compound interest, whether in money or in relationships or love or health or activities or habits. 
  所以，如果我看到我身边的任何人，比方说，我在和别人做生意，而他们和别人的想法是短期的，那么我就不想再和这个人做生意了，因为我认为生活中的所有好处都来自复利，无论是金钱、人际关系、爱情、健康、活动还是习惯。
  40:22
  So I only wanna be around people that I know I'm gonna be around with for the rest of my life and I only wanna work on things that I know have the long term payout. Another one is like I only believe in pure relationships. 
  所以，我只想和那些我知道余生都会在一起的人在一起，我只想做那些我知道会有长期回报的事情。另一个原因是，我只相信纯粹的关系。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv8g3t960xvz2pa1471j27cv))
- which is if you have a criticism of someone, then don't criticize the person, criticize the general approach or criticize kind of that class of activities. 
  我并不总是遵循它，但我认为我遵循的足够多了，它给我的生活带来了改变，那就是如果你对某人有批评，那就不要批评这个人，而是批评一般的方法或批评那一类活动。
  43:08
  But if you have to praise somebody, then always try and find the person who best, who's the best example of what you're praising and then praise that person specifically. 
  但是，如果你必须赞美某个人，那就一定要努力找到最合适的人，他是你所赞美的最好的榜样，然后专门赞美这个人。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv8g6dm1an0x0a87wcfaktgg))
