## Highlights
- I have not yet made much progress in those tests and I really like My setup with the H6. It's extremely, extremely reliable. Number two, I'm going to move the order around a little bit. Any pointers on being a good interviewer? All right. 
  我还没有在这些测试中取得太大进展，但我非常喜欢我的 H6 设置。它非常非常可靠。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz435fcs4mnfsstc0h2tvjrj))
- I like to tell people the first question that I'm going to start with, and that's something that I very often ask, say, TV interviewers or others when I'm being interviewed. I don't need to know all the questions. 
  我喜欢告诉别人我要先问的第一个问题，这也是我在接受采访时经常问电视采访者或其他人的问题。我不需要知道所有的问题。
  11:46
  Just tell me what the first question is so that I don't stumble right out of the gate. So I tell them you're probably going to start with this question. First third is going to bounce all over your bio. We're going to talk about your life. 
  告诉我第一个问题是什么，这样我就不会一开始就磕磕绊绊了。所以我告诉他们，你可能会从这个问题开始。第一个问题会在你的简历上跳来跳去。我们要谈谈你的生活。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz438wf46e9cjx838w0pn6jr))

- This is a show about tactics and routines, favorite books, things that my readers can use, things that will inspire and help my readers get through their own challenges, recover from their own mistakes, etc. This is not a gotcha show. 
  这是一个关于战术和套路、最喜欢的书、我的读者可以使用的东西、能够激励和帮助我的读者度过他们自己的挑战、从他们自己的错误中恢复过来的东西等的节目。这不是一档 "刁难 "节目。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz43agxwt92c1azbwwq4dwx8))
- And folks who are interviewed or people who talk for a living or do a fair amount of talking will, over time, just like stand-up comedians, work on their material. 
  接受采访的人，或者以谈话为生的人，或者经常说话的人，随着时间的推移，就像脱口秀喜剧演员一样，会在他们的素材上下功夫。

  And the smarter of them or the smart of them will keep track of this, of course, and naturally do this. So they will know That they have three or four absolute guaranteed hits for almost any audience. 
  当然，他们中的聪明人或精明人也会跟踪这一点，并自然而然地这样做。这样，他们就会知道，他们有三、四个绝对保证能打动几乎所有观众的作品。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz43bws5rw55nb4rg2jpgm61))
- And then when we ask questions, I'll have no more than say a two-page spread in a notebook open with three to five points on either side. So for a 90-minute to three-hour interview, I'll have no more than 10 points. 
  然后当我们提问时，我会在笔记本上写下不超过两页的内容，两边各三到五个要点。因此，对于 90 分钟到三小时的采访，我的要点不会超过 10 个。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz43egewrepevyr08ay7kkgt))
- Number one, ask questions that you actually fucking care about. 
  如果你能认真倾听答案，不急于求成，就不会出现这种情况。第一，提出你真正关心的问题。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz43hfwypw9twdfwh2ybcjkj))
- They record for about three hours, I want to say, and then cut it down to whatever it is in its finished form, 45 to 60 minutes. I would rather have a slightly more awkward conversation but not know the answers. Otherwise it's boring for me. 
  我想说的是，他们录制大约 3 个小时，然后剪辑成 45 到 60 分钟的成品。我宁可对话稍微尴尬一点，但不知道答案。否则我会觉得很无聊。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz43j51p1ct58fhe46t6rr01))
- Uh, in this context, let the silence do the work means if you ask a question and there is silence, awkward silence, for a few seconds. A few seconds is a really long time in conversation. I mean, try to just sit still for, say, five seconds. 
  呃，在这里，"让沉默发挥作用 "指的是，如果你问了一个问题，然后出现了几秒钟的沉默，尴尬的沉默。在谈话中，几秒钟是很长的时间。我的意思是，试着静静地坐着，比如说，五秒钟。

  All right, let's actually pretend that I'm asking you a question. So, what was it like when that happened? That's about five seconds. It's a fucking long time. 
  好吧，就当我在问你问题吧那么，当时是什么情况？大约五秒钟时间真他妈长

  And my instinct, which is true for millions and billions of people, was to jump in and try to help the interviewee. And I'd say, well, put it another way. Or we could come back to that and ask another question. 
  我的本能，也是千千万万人的本能，就是跳出来试图帮助受访者。我会说，好吧，换一种说法。或者我们可以回到这个问题上，再问一个问题。

  And Cal's advice was let the silence do the work. Just wait it out. And this is easier via Skype than it is in person, in my experience. But let the silence do the work. And those are a few pointers to start with. There are many more. Study. 
  卡尔的建议是让沉默来解决问题静静地等待。根据我的经验，通过 Skype 比面对面更容易做到这一点。但还是要让沉默发挥作用。这只是我的一些建议。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz43mt6hd8rhgke22ey7keqw))

- And I decided on that frequency because I found two episodes per week, so eight per month to overwhelm me when listening to long-form audio. 
  我之所以决定这样的频率，是因为我发现每周两集，每月八集的长篇音频让我应接不暇。
  25:18
  And I found six to be just enough to support the number of interviews that I want to do, which are all very personal. I'm reaching out to all of these interviewees to solve very personal problems or improve aspects of myself. 
  我发现 6 个采访正好可以支持我想做的采访数量，而这些采访都是非常个人化的。我接触所有这些受访者，都是为了解决非常个人化的问题或改善自己的某些方面。
  25:37
  They're always personally driven. And that's roughly the cadence that I want to sustain. So six per month, that means you have two weeks per month with single episodes and two weeks per month with two episodes. 
  它们总是由个人驱动的。这也是我想保持的大致节奏。所以每月六集，也就是每月有两周是单集，两周是双集。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz43rgb28a5tmz9cjm5q1j94))

- to increase the price per episode or their ability to pay an increased price per episode even if you double in size. If you try to monetize really early, you're going to be doing, in many cases, 
  即使你的规模扩大了一倍，他们也有能力提高每集节目的价格或支付更高的价格。如果你很早就尝试货币化，那么在很多情况下，你都会这么做、

- As someone who focuses on risk mitigation and controlling as many variables as possible, I like email. In the last few years, I have doubled and tripled and quadrupled down on that focus. Why? 
  作为一个注重降低风险和控制尽可能多变量的人，我喜欢电子邮件。在过去的几年里，我将这一重点加倍、加倍、再加倍。为什么呢？

  因为这种直接的通信方式不可能轻易被夺走。我还可以更换电子邮件服务提供商。这种灵活性和持久性是社交媒体平台无法保证的。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz4456qw9anbk35xsqs48myr))

  我并不在意每个人对每部作品的喜爱程度，这为你消除了巨大的压力，让你想清楚一切。发挥编辑的瑞士风格，取悦所有人。不要试图取悦所有人。
  42:30
  Try to create raving fans that comprise maybe 5 to 10 percent of your audience for each post. That's my goal. I don't care about the rest. They'll have their turn later. But for now, if they're like, what? 
  尝试为每篇文章创造 5%到 10%的狂热粉丝。这就是我的目标。我不在乎其他人。以后会轮到他们的。但现在，如果他们觉得，什么？

  顺便说一下，如果有人想知道，我是否应该写一些少于 500 字或少于 1000 字的文章？我的一些博文有一两万字。
  49:15
  And many of them are my most popular posts that end up being perennially revisited. And much like real estate, this is one of my goals, I want A blog post I put up to be more valuable two years from now than the day that I publish it. 
  其中有很多都是我最受欢迎的文章，这些文章最终会被人们常年重温。和房地产一样，这也是我的目标之一，我希望我发表的一篇博文在两年后比发表当天更有价值。

  And that relates to Google Juice and other things. My most popular posts are all years old at this point. And they appreciate over time. So I go super long form. Tim Urban takes it to a whole new level. And I did a podcast episode with him. 
  这与 Google Juice 和其他方面有关。在这一点上，我最受欢迎的帖子都是几年前的了。随着时间的推移，它们会不断升值。所以我采用超长的形式。蒂姆-乌尔班（Tim Urban）将其提升到了一个全新的高度。我和他一起做过一集播客。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz44cs9rp613zwew1trba8pr))
