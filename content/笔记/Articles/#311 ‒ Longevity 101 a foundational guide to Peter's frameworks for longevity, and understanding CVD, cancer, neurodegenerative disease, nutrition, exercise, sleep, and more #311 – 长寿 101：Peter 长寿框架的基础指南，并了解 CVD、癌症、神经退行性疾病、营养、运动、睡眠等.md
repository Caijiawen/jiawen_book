- Summary: The guide discusses the concepts of lifespan and healthspan, emphasizing the importance of living longer while also maintaining good health. It highlights that improving healthspan can positively impact lifespan and argues for equal attention to both in healthcare. The text also explores various diseases and factors, like nutrition and exercise, that influence longevity.

## Highlights
- I want to say that again because I think it is, for me at least, it's such a profound statement. If you never thought once about trying to live a longer life and focused relentlessly on how can I improve My strength, 
  我想再说一遍，因为我认为，至少对我来说，这是一个意义深远的说法。如果你从来没有想过要活得更长久，并不懈地关注我如何提高我的力量，
  15:26
  my endurance, my stamina, and again, all the nuance around these things, my balance, my coordination, my processing speed, my working memory, my emotional health, my happiness, my relationships. 
  我的耐力，我的耐力，还有围绕这些事情的所有细微差别，我的平衡，我的协调，我的处理速度，我的工作记忆，我的情绪健康，我的幸福，我的人际关系。
  15:38
  If you only focused on those things and never once thought about heart disease, cancer, Alzheimer's disease specifically, I still believe you would capture three quarters of the way towards optimizing your lifespan. 
  如果你只关注这些事情，而从未专门考虑过心脏病、癌症、阿尔茨海默氏病，我仍然相信你将获得四分之三的优化寿命的方法。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j4k70z4dnd2g2q0xtnhmdtjc))
- And part of the reason for this, Nick, is there's a very simple but surprisingly accurate adage, which states, what's good for the heart is good for the brain. And study after study after study have demonstrated the following. 
  尼克，造成这种情况的部分原因是有一句非常简单但出奇准确的格言，它指出，对心脏有益的东西对大脑也有好处。一项又一项的研究证明了以下几点。
  41:19
  Every intervention that we take to lower the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease also reduces the risk of dementia. 
  我们为降低动脉粥样硬化性心血管疾病风险而采取的每一项干预措施也可以降低痴呆症的风险。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j4k797kfx6m77trvc5hs618v))
- Now, an area where dementia has an even bigger positive impact in intervention than cardiovascular disease is with that of exercise. 
  现在，痴呆症对干预的积极影响比心血管疾病更大，那就是运动。
  42:03
  So, it's no surprise that exercise improves a person's odds of not getting and or surviving cardiovascular disease, cancer, dementia. 
  因此，锻炼可以提高一个人不患心血管疾病、癌症和痴呆症的几率，或者存活下来，这一点也就不足为奇了。
  42:14
  But I would say that the evidence for the benefits of exercise are both greater in magnitude and greater in confidence when it comes to the prevention of neurodegenerative disease. 
  但我想说的是，在预防神经退行性疾病方面，运动益处的证据不仅数量更大，而且可信度也更高。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j4k7a9xrarwxdk9p8q2ws3mx))
- It starts on the foundation, you have to have stability, you have to have the chassis Basically, I'd say the chassis and the tires. 
  它从基础开始，你必须有稳定性，你必须有底盘基本上，我会说底盘和轮胎。
  56:36
  You have to have every aspect of the motor control, coordination, ability to dissipate force, ability to receive force, ability to balance. There's so much that goes into stability that I think got a full half chapter in the book. 
  你必须具备运动控制、协调、消散力的能力、接收力的能力、平衡能力的各个方面。关于稳定性的内容太多了，我认为这本书占据了整整半章的篇幅。
  56:54
  And it's far and away the most complicated to explain, but it's really obvious to see it when it's not there. So every one of us is lacking in stability and it was the biggest re-education for me as I pivoted to this way of training. 
  这无疑是最难以解释的，但当它不存在时，看到它确实很明显。所以我们每个人都缺乏稳定性，这对我来说是一次最大的再教育，因为我转向了这种训练方式。
  57:09
  So it's everything from learning how to appropriately pressurize your intra-abdominal space to how to unlock your ribs, maintain an appropriate center of gravity, How to be able to isometrically contract muscles as necessary, 
  因此，从学习如何适当地对腹腔内空间加压，到如何解锁肋骨、保持适当的重心、如何能够在必要时等长收缩肌肉，无所不包，
  57:25
  how to be able to do it under control, how to have good foot mechanics, right? I mean, all of these things we've done dedicated podcasts on because each component of this stability game is quite nuanced. 
  如何能够在控制下做到这一点，如何拥有良好的脚部力学，对吧？我的意思是，所有这些事情我们都做了专门的播客，因为这个稳定性游戏的每个组成部分都非常微妙。
  57:36
  And the good news is while most of us show up to the middle part of our life with enormous deficits here, they're all retrainable. We're actually still quite plastic in our old age. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j4k7vbw55kjgxm8drfv52dq6))
- So, here are the two that I can tell you with a very, very high degree of certainty. The first is that the single most important input from nutrition to a person's overall health is energy balance. 
  因此，我可以非常非常肯定地告诉您以下两点。首先，营养对一个人整体健康最重要的输入是能量平衡。
  1:01:49
  Stated another way, the energy input of food is the first order determinant of health. Maybe stated another way, the total calories you consume would be the most important thing, not the only thing. 
  换句话说，食物的能量输入是健康的首要决定因素。也许换句话说，你消耗的总热量将是最重要的，而不是唯一的。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j4k82q3ffkzd6xfx9snpemjm))
- The second thing that is abundantly clear is that protein is the macronutrient we should be least flexible on. Stated another way, we can be quite flexible on how much carbohydrate and fat we consume to fill our energy needs. 
  第二件非常清楚的事情是，蛋白质是我们最不应该灵活运用的常量营养素。换句话说，我们可以非常灵活地决定消耗多少碳水化合物和脂肪来满足我们的能量需求。
  1:03:10
  But because protein is not consumed for the purpose of ATP generation, which is the principal reason we consume carbohydrates and fats, although fats are also essential for some structural purposes, 
  但是，由于蛋白质不是为了生成 ATP 而消耗的，而这是我们消耗碳水化合物和脂肪的主要原因，尽管脂肪对于某些结构目的也是必不可少的，
  1:03:24
  we cannot be too flexible or compromising in our protein requirements. In other words, if you really wanted to just come up with a single number to give people, 
  我们对蛋白质的需求不能太灵活或妥协。换句话说，如果你真的想拿出一个数字来给人们，
  1:03:35
  I would say on average about 1.6 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight should be consumed by everybody. Now again, I hate saying that because there's truly nothing that you can say across the board. 
  我想说，每个人平均每公斤体重应该摄入大约 1.6 克蛋白质。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j4k84g3hj9dk1m9j34kk65mn))
- Give yourself about eight hours to be in bed. Make the room as dark as possible, as cold as possible. 
  给自己大约八个小时的时间躺在床上。让房间尽可能黑暗、尽可能寒冷。
  1:13:43
  And detach yourself from anything stimulating, especially upsetting, which is work, social media, that kind of stuff, for two hours before bed. 
  睡前两个小时，让自己远离任何刺激的东西，尤其是令人不安的东西，比如工作、社交媒体之类的东西。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j4k87cksfz1cbqpba048tq84))
