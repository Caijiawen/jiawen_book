## Highlights
- I didn't reach my athletic peak until I was 43. I didn't write my first book until I was 44. I didn't start my podcast until I was 45. At 30, I thought my life was over. At 52, I know it's just beginning. 
  我直到 43 岁才达到运动高峰。我 44 岁才写了第一本书。我直到 45 岁才开始播客。30 岁时，我以为我的人生已经结束。52岁时，我知道人生才刚刚开始。

  Keep running, never give up and watch your kite soar. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hymhp4xvzm605hg2hswcc6qv))

- And I think in terms of addiction and recovery more broadly, I think it's important for people to understand that for somebody who is addicted and who's behaving poorly or all of the stuff that addicts do, 
  我认为，就更广泛的成瘾和康复而言，我认为重要的是让人们明白，对于那些有毒瘾、行为不端或有毒瘾的人来说，这一点很重要、
  30:29
  it's not a referendum on moral character. It's like they're suffering from an illness that wants to kill them. 
  这不是对道德品质的公投。他们就像得了一种病，想要置他们于死地。
  30:37
  And when they get sober, We think of drugs and alcohol or gambling or whatever behavioral addiction that someone might have as the problem that has been eradicated. But in truth, the behavior or the substance is the solution to the problem. 
  当他们清醒过来时，我们会认为毒品、酒精、赌博或任何行为上瘾的人都是已经被根除的问题。但事实上，行为或物质才是问题的解决方案。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hymj4gk3m1wqb7y1hey2fhwa))
- where he studied the neurochemistry of this and realized that behavior has to come first and thoughts, perceptions, emotions follow from that. And when you think about that in the context of our daily lives, like let's just use running, 
  在那里，他研究了其中的神经化学原理，并意识到行为必须先行，而思想、认知和情感则随之而来。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hymjcrw5yqag7ft75w33xecc))

- for example, like if you wake up in the morning and you're supposed to do a run because you're training for some race and you don't feel like doing it, we all resort to that state where we think, well, I don't want to do it right now. 
  例如，如果你早上醒来，因为要参加比赛训练而应该去跑步，但你却不想去，我们都会陷入这样的状态：我现在不想去。
  50:18
  I'll just wait until I feel like doing it and then I'll do it then. And when we And if we don't engage that way, we end up never doing it, right? 
  我会等到我想做的时候再去做。如果我们不这样做，我们就永远不会去做，对吗？
  50:26
  Like if you're waiting until you feel like doing something, chances are you're probably never gonna get to it. But to take the action despite how you feel about it is the thing that catalyzes the state change. 
  就像如果你一直在等待，直到你想去做某件事情，那么你很可能永远都不会去做。而不顾自己的感受去行动，才是催化状态改变的关键。
  50:38
  And in my case, or anybody who's a runner, they'll tell you when they finish the run, they're always glad that they did it. They don't generally regret it. And then they feel better. 
  就我而言，或者任何一个跑步者，他们都会告诉你，当他们跑完之后，他们总是很高兴自己做到了。他们一般不会后悔然后他们会感觉更好。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hymjc0vqrjdqnf1y1hh1zdt5))

- Yeah, I have answers. So the first, I think overarching answer is mood follows action, right? So I know that when I am training consistently with a purpose of some type, not just going to yoga a few times a week, I can do that. 
  是的，我有答案。首先，我认为最重要的答案是，心情决定行动，对吗？所以我知道，当我带着某种目的持续训练时，而不仅仅是每周去做几次瑜伽，我就能做到这一点。
  1:07:07
  I can lift weights two or three times a week, but training with a purpose I find just leads me to a better mental psycho-emotional state more often than not. It is the most reliable Intervention, so to speak. So that would be part one. 
  我可以每周举重两三次，但我发现有目的的训练往往能让我进入更好的精神心理情绪状态。可以说，这是最可靠的干预措施。这就是第一部分。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hymjzdq5weby3yxdx5kmhhcb))

- And it becomes, the more you do it, the more emotionally engaged you get with it, and then these things tend to develop a life of their own. 
  你做得越多，感情就越投入，然后这些事情就会发展出自己的生命。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hymk8ay2ngxt2hhd3xw1wgfr))
- Zone 2 is the level of output where basically you can get up and do it every day and quite often you complete the workout and you feel like you didn't do anything and you have this impulse to want to go faster so you have to hold back from doing that. 
  第 2 区是输出水平，基本上你每天都可以起来锻炼，但很多时候，你完成锻炼后会觉得自己什么都没做，有一种想跑得更快的冲动，所以你必须忍住，不要这么做。

  But essentially what it does is it, as Peter talks about, helps you develop A greater mitochondrial density in your muscles and in ultra endurance, this is absolutely crucial because there's nothing about ultra endurance that is fast. 
  但从根本上说，它的作用正如彼得所说的那样，能帮助你提高肌肉中线粒体的密度，而在超耐力运动中，这绝对是至关重要的，因为超耐力运动没有什么是快的。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hymkbx9a249y423yqh253j3a))
- When I began training for these races, my zone two pace when I was running was like 10 minutes a mile or 1030 or something like that. 
  当我开始为这些比赛进行训练时，我的第二区跑步速度是 10 分钟一英里或 1030 或类似的速度。
  1:20:03
  But by rigorously adhering to this without doing any interval training or any tempo work over a two year period, I got to the point where I could run seven minute miles at the same heart rate. 
  但在两年的时间里，我严格遵守了这一原则，没有进行任何间歇训练或任何节奏训练，从而达到了在相同心率下跑 7 分钟英里的水平。
  1:20:14
  So the same amount of energy output, but that level of increase in speed, not by doing any speed work, but by literally creating efficiencies and developing that mitochondrial density. 
  因此，同样的能量输出，但速度的提高，不是通过做任何速度训练，而是通过从字面上创造效率和发展线粒体密度。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hymkn5e1etn07jscanz2t3jd))

- So essentially, I'm early to bed, early to rise. I go to bed like around nine. And uh, generally get up around five, five, between five and six. And the early hours are, are really protected as my own time. So morning meditation, journaling. 
  因此，我基本上是早睡早起。九点左右上床一般五点左右起床 五点到六点之间早起的时间是我的私人时间所以，早晨冥想，写日记。
  1:33:52
  Writing, creative projects, no meetings, no phone calls. Like certainly, like we're doing this podcast this morning, so I'll make exceptions, like we're doing this in the morning, 
  写作，创意项目，不开会，不打电话。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hymm5b903pydt302t064xz2y))
