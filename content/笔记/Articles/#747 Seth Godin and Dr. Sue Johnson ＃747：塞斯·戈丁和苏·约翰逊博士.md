## Highlights
- Well, first we have to scroll back. There's a difference between freelancers and entrepreneurs. Most people who are independent are freelancers. They get paid when they work. They do good work and get paid for it. 
  好吧，首先我们必须向后滚动。自由职业者和企业家之间是有区别的。大多数独立的人都是自由职业者。他们工作时获得报酬。他们工作出色并因此获得报酬。

  A few people are entrepreneurs building a business bigger than themselves, a business that makes them money when they sleep, a business where they don't actually do the work that the customer is buying, 
  有些人是企业家，他们建立了一家比自己更大的企业，一家在睡觉时就能赚钱的企业，一家他们实际上并不做客户购买的工作的企业，

  and a business that they can sell one day. So we look at Larry Ellison. Larry Ellison doesn't code at Oracle. Larry Ellison doesn't make most of the sales calls. What does Larry Ellison do, actually? 
  以及他们有一天可以出售的一项业务。所以我们来看看拉里·埃里森。拉里·埃里森 (Larry Ellison) 不在 Oracle 编写代码。拉里·埃里森 (Larry Ellison) 并不打大部分销售电话。拉里·埃里森实际上是做什么的？

  So the first thing I would say to the person who's confused is, well are you an entrepreneur or a freelancer? If you're an entrepreneur, then you have signed up for a series of choices and challenges. 
  因此，我要对困惑的人说的第一件事是，你是企业家还是自由职业者？如果您是一名企业家，那么您就已经接受了一系列的选择和挑战。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0qq2tt2w83jwjvrrr1knfhz))
- If you spend two hours a day without an electronic device, looking your kid in the eye, talking to them and solving interesting problems, you will raise a different kid than someone who doesn't do that. 
  如果你每天花两个小时不使用电子设备，看着孩子的眼睛，与他们交谈并解决有趣的问题，你会养育出一个与不这样做的人不同的孩子。

  That's one of the reasons why I cook dinner every night because what a wonderful semi-distracted environment for the kid to tell you the truth, 
  这就是我每天晚上做饭的原因之一，因为对于孩子来说，这是一个多么美妙的半分心的环境来告诉你真相，

  for you to have low stakes but super important conversations with someone who's important to you. That this idea, get home from work, put on your sneakers and go for a walk with your kid. 
  让您能够与对您重要的人进行低风险但非常重要的对话。有了这个想法，下班回家，穿上运动鞋，和孩子一起去散步。
