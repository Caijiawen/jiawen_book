- And if you look at the, say, guest list from this podcast or people that I invest alongside, it seems like a very impressive list. And I'm impressed by a lot of these people. But it was built in a very strategic, a very methodical way. 
  如果你看看这个播客的嘉宾名单，或者和我一起投资的人，这似乎是一个非常令人印象深刻的名单。很多人都给我留下了深刻印象。但它是以一种非常有策略、非常有条理的方式建立起来的。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz494ks7r4t3q59400xkngqy))
- And you build a network there in the right way, in a methodical way that really focuses on sort of long-term mutual relationships as opposed to transactions. 
  你要以正确的方式，有条不紊地在那里建立一个网络，真正注重长期的相互关系，而不是交易。
  05:51
  And a lot of the advice I think is counterintuitive or non-obvious, but it's very specific that you never have to network again ever. And once you set that ball in motion, it's like a snowball going down a hill. 
  我认为很多建议都是反直觉或非显而易见的，但它非常具体，让你永远不必再建立网络。一旦你开始行动，就会像滚雪球一样越滚越大。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz49pxgvk47ak46vvkpga024))
- Don't dismiss people, don't be a dick, and don't rush. Those are the three core tenets of success at an event like South by Southwest. Don't dismiss people. You should behave here like everyone you interact with has the potential. 
  不要轻视别人，不要做混蛋，不要急于求成。这是在西南偏南这样的活动中取得成功的三大核心原则。不要轻视他人。在这里，你应该表现得好像你接触的每个人都有潜力。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz4a9j4b672edxcx3za50r26))
- We sat right next to each other at the movie and then a few years later, I ended up collaborating with him and he profiled me for a day in the life. Okay, so again, treat everyone like they're important because they are. 
  看电影的时候，我们就坐在一起，几年后，我和他合作，他给我做了一天的生活报道。好吧，还是那句话，对待每个人都要把他们当做重要的人，因为他们确实很重要。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz4aambfs3ekfqcmz8zq82x9))

- many of whom are equally impressive in their own right. And I would go up to the moderator, who's usually not nearly as mobbed, And I would give them a quick explanation. I'd say, hey, this is my first time at South by. I don't know anyone. 
  他们中的许多人本身也同样令人印象深刻。我会去找主持人，他通常没有那么多人，我会给他们一个简单的解释。我会说，嘿，这是我第一次来 "南方我谁都不认识
  18:51
  I'm kind of lost. I just finished my first book. It's about A, B, and C. Personally, I'm interested in, at the time, say, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, this, this, and this. Is there anyone here you think I might really hit it off with? 
  我有点迷茫。我刚写完我的第一本书。我个人对巴西柔术、这个、这个和这个感兴趣。你觉得这里有谁能和我一拍即合吗？
  19:03
  Anyone you think I should talk to? I'm pretty good at this and this. And they'd be like, yeah, sure, yeah, I think, yeah, you should talk to this person and this person. 
  你觉得我应该和谁谈谈吗？我很擅长这个和那个。他们会说，是的，当然，是的，我觉得，是的，你应该和这个人和这个人谈谈。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz4adjw8qad4r6h38xnj61dp))
- you might be tempted to go straight for the person who has the biggest megaphone, the biggest site, the most Twitter followers. 
  你可能会直接选择拥有最大的扩音器、最大的网站、最多 Twitter 追随者的人。
  25:14
  And the problem with that is that you're going to be one of a thousand people who pitch this person while they're here. 99.9% of the time, it won't work. You can try. There's no harm in doing it tactfully. It usually won't work. 
  这样做的问题是，当这个人在这里的时候，你将成为千千万万个向他推销的人中的一个。99.9%的情况下，这不会奏效。你可以试试。婉转一点也无妨。通常不会奏效。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz4amm5hb1v4rt73d6rrzkqf))
- And I would also say that don't necessarily focus on the people who you perceive as the A-listers or VIPs now. Try to find the pre-VIPs. Does that make sense? You're trying to find the up-and-comers. 
  我还想说的是，不一定要关注那些你现在认为是 A 级人物或 VIP 的人。试着去寻找VIP之前的人。有道理吗？你要找的是后起之秀。
  26:42
  So you ask, again, ask people who have been here a few times, who are the best up-and-coming hot designers? The folks that are not very well-known who should be well-known. 
  所以你会问，再问一次，问那些来过这里几次的人，谁是最好的新晋热门设计师？那些不太出名但应该出名的人。
  26:53
  Or who are the hot up-and-coming filmmakers who haven't had any press? Who are they? Go meet those people. 
  或者，谁是炙手可热的新晋电影制作人，却没有任何媒体报道？他们是谁？去见见他们吧。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz4aq9ftd1vj6b3rmgfmr02n))
- Number two, if you had to pick people out of the crowd, I would say go for the most relaxed, unrushed looking person. Not necessarily the A-list or surrounded by a huge phalanx of people, if that's the right word. 
  第二，如果要从人群中挑人，我会选择看起来最放松、最不匆忙的人。不一定是明星，也不一定被一大群人簇拥着，如果用这个词来形容的话。
  30:57
  Because, unless you just want to listen. If you want to listen, that's fine, but you're not going to get a lot of air time. Look for the most relaxed people in the room. 
  因为，除非你只想听。如果你想听，那很好，但你不会有太多的发言时间。寻找房间里最放松的人。
  31:03
  They either have very, very little going on or they've kind of already made it and they don't feel rushed. So, hit or miss, but if you have to pick people out of the crowd, I would say go for the most relaxed, unrushed looking person. 
  他们要么没什么事，要么已经做好了，不会让人觉得匆忙。所以，不成功便成仁，但如果你非要从人群中挑人的话，我会选择看起来最放松、最不着急的人。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz4awzb9mf52k95k9hm75k6z))

- If you look at the people I spent the most time with in 2007, about 90% of them, this is 2007. What is that, seven years ago? Oh my God. They're still some of my closest friends to this day. That is what you want. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz4b084y6z80v0xz5yd8mdgq))
- If you do it right, it will change your life. So again, just in summary. Don't dismiss people. Don't be a dick. And don't rush. Play the long game. Thank you. 
  如果你做对了，它将改变你的生活。所以，我再次总结一下。不要拒绝别人。不要做混蛋。不要急于求成。从长计议。谢谢 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz4b0qxakvtew58w91eztdpb))
