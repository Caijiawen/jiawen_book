## Highlights
- For instance, If I have friends over and I want to spend time with them, but I also want to get outdoors and do this workout. And if they're interested in getting some outdoor movement as well, we'll all just head out for a hike. 
  例如，如果我有朋友来访，我想和他们在一起，但我也想去户外做这项锻炼。如果他们也对户外运动感兴趣，我们就一起去远足。

  And if they are less fit than I am or intend to move more slowly, well, then I'll throw on a, you know, a 10 or 15, maybe even 30 pound backpack so that I get a good workout out of it. 
  如果他们的体能比我差，或者打算走得慢一些，那么我就会背上一个 10 磅、15 磅甚至 30 磅的背包，这样我就能得到很好的锻炼。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hx19h0185e1fvmach5756h8a))
- Skipping a workout every once in a while is not going to crater your entire fitness program. It's simply not. That said, 
  偶尔不锻炼并不会让你的整个健身计划崩溃。根本不会。话虽如此、

  for sake of physical health and for sake of just feeling good about your commitment and follow through to your fitness regimen, you should try on average to make somewhere between 85 and 95% of your workouts. 
  为了身体健康，也为了对自己的承诺感觉良好，并坚持自己的健身计划，你应该尽量平均完成 85% 到 95% 的锻炼。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hx19knt434qk2s1988v43g72))
- And if you schedule things well, And in particular, if you leave your phone out of the gym, if you're able to do that, 
  如果你能很好地安排时间，尤其是把手机留在健身房外，如果你能做到这一点、

  I know sometimes we need the phone to communicate with people or the potential to communicate with people if people need to get a hold of us. 
  我知道，有时我们需要用电话与人沟通，或者如果人们需要联系我们，我们也需要用电话与人沟通。

  But if you can leave your phone outside of the gym, you'll be amazed at how quickly you move through these workouts. Likewise, with your cardiovascular training sessions. 
  但是，如果你能把手机留在健身房外，你会惊讶地发现这些训练的速度是如此之快。同样，心血管训练也是如此。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hx1cfepehjkcvm26st0kvcq7))
- I prefer to get my workouts done first thing in the morning. So I like to get up, hydrate, get some electrolytes in my system, get some caffeine in my system if I'm going to work out. That's right. I said it. 
  我更喜欢早上第一件事就是锻炼。所以我喜欢起床，补充水分，在体内补充一些电解质，如果要锻炼的话，在体内补充一些咖啡因。没错，我就是这么说的。我说过了 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hx19mcnp5frkahr10mc6yafd))
- I like to have my workouts done before 9 a.m. and ideally before 830 a.m. so that I can move into my I work day. However, there are days where that simply doesn't happen. 
  我喜欢在上午 9 点之前完成锻炼，最好是在 830 点之前，这样我就可以进入我的工作日。但是，有些时候根本做不到。
  18:12
  And then the question is, is it okay to move a workout from its typical time, like for me, 7.30 AM or so to the afternoon? And the answer is yes. There's simply no reason why that's not okay. 
  那么问题来了，把锻炼从通常的时间，比如对我来说，早上 7 点半左右，挪到下午可以吗？答案是肯定的。没有理由不可以。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hx1cj31wh7y4krtv7a457rv3))
- If you work out at a given time pretty consistently, your autonomic nervous system will start to anticipate that timing and you'll start to feel an increase in energy around that time. That is not an imagined thing. It's a real thing. 
  如果你坚持在某个时间锻炼，你的自律神经系统就会开始预知这个时间，你就会开始感觉到在这个时间前后精力充沛。这不是想象出来的。它是真实存在的。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hx1cjw39f19ra5efrkamz0hv))
- really physical fitness is about being able to lean into other aspects of life with more vigor. At least that's what it's about for me. And I think that's what it's about for most people. 
  真正的强身健体是为了能够更有活力地投入到生活的其他方面。至少对我来说是这样。我认为这也是大多数人的健身目的。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hx1bnfyzjc24av1sy0kc583d))
