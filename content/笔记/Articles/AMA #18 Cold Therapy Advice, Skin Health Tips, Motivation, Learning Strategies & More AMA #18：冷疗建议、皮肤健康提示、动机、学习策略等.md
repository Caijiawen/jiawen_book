  I now have a box for my phone that I've dedicated to keeping my phone in when I'm busy doing Other types of work for which the presence of the phone would be an intrusion. It would limit my work output. 
  我现在有一个手机盒子，当我忙于做其他类型的工作时，手机的存在会妨碍我，我专门把它放在里面。这会限制我的工作产出。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j4gw2hw3r59xef5esnzj0rjw))
