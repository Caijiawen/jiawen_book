## Highlights
- -> Guilty of just scalping single digit % moves on leverage when I could have just spot longed for multiples and without that much stress One strategy that I should have done more of was taking my profits from leverage and adding on to my core spot positions and holding that 
  我应该多做的一个策略是，从杠杆中获取利润，并将其添加到我的核心现货头寸中，并持有该头寸。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h24wm0e4s5xn729vf6pna12z))
- -> Greatly underestimating illiquidity and volume. The thing with most shitcoins is that once no one talks about it on CT, volume and liquidity will die off. Being a paper millionaire doesn’t mean anything if you will cause 50% slippage if you exit a position ![💀](https://abs-0.twimg.com/emoji/v2/svg/1f480.svg "骷髅头") 
  --极大地低估了非流动性和交易量。大多数狗屎币的情况是，一旦没有人在CT上谈论它，数量和流动性就会消失。 如果你在出仓时会造成50%的滑点，那么成为纸面上的百万富翁并没有什么意义 ![💀](https://abs-0.twimg.com/emoji/v2/svg/1f480.svg "骷髅头") 。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h24wnzxs2w1ej6vgnbkj7m9v))
