- Category: #articles
- Summary: This guide offers advice to aspiring machine learning researchers on choosing problems, managing time, and gaining a deep understanding of the field. It emphasizes the importance of selecting the right research problems, making continual progress, and personal growth. The document highlights the distinction between idea-driven and goal-driven research approaches and recommends the latter for most researchers due to its specificity and focus on achieving new AI capabilities. It also touches on the challenges and benefits of each approach, providing insights into how researchers can navigate their research paths effectively in the machine learning domain.

## Highlights
- The keys to success are working on the right problems, making continual progress on them, and achieving continual personal growth. This essay is comprised of three sections, each covering one of these topics. 
  成功的关键在于解决正确的问题，在这些问题上不断取得进展，并实现个人的持续成长。本文由三个部分组成，每个部分涵盖其中一个主题。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr449gqq5afxpwqst35tp7y4))
- Your ability to choose the right problems to work on is even more important than your raw technical skill. This taste in problems is something you’ll develop over time by watching which ideas prosper and which ones are forgotten. You’ll see which ones serve as building blocks for new ideas and results, and which ones are ignored because they are too complicated or too fragile, or because the incremental improvement is too small. 
  你选择正确问题的能力甚至比你的原始技术能力更重要。随着时间的推移，你会通过观察哪些想法会成功，哪些想法会被遗忘来培养对问题的品味。你会发现哪些问题是新想法和新成果的基石，哪些问题因为太复杂、太脆弱，或者因为改进的增量太小而被忽视。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr44f7g0btnn3p14g01neree))
- Spend time reflecting on what research is useful and fruitful. Think about questions like 
  花时间思考哪些研究是有用的、富有成效的。思考以下问题
  1. When is theory useful? 
  理论何时有用？
  2. When are empirical results transferable? 
  经验成果何时可以转让？
  3. What causes some ideas to get wide uptake, whereas others are forgotten? 
  是什么原因导致一些想法被广泛接受，而另一些想法却被遗忘？
  4. What are the trends in your field? Which lines of work will make the other ones obsolete? 
  您所在领域的发展趋势是什么？哪些行业将淘汰其他行业？ ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr44npw6ew1v5pzez85cb5vh))
- One pitfall of goal-driven research is taking your goal too literally. If you have a specific capability in mind, there’s probably some way to achieve it in an uninteresting way that doesn’t advance the field of machine learning. You should constrain your search to solutions that seem general and can be applied to other problems. 
  目标驱动型研究的一个误区是过于照本宣科。如果你心中有一个特定的能力，那么很可能有某种方法能以一种无趣的方式实现它，而这种方式并不会推动机器学习领域的发展。您应该将搜索范围限制在那些看似通用且可应用于其他问题的解决方案上。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr45kse2d5pr72zmnxn3571g))
- Sometimes, people who are both exceptionally smart and hard-working fail to do great research. In my view, the main reason for this failure is that they work on unimportant problems. When you embark on a research project, you should ask yourself: how large is the potential upside? Will this be a 10% improvement or a 10X improvement? I often see researchers take on projects that seem sensible but could only possibly yield a small improvement to some metric. 
  有时，既聪明又勤奋的人却做不好伟大的研究。我认为，失败的主要原因是他们研究的问题不重要。当你开始一个研究项目时，你应该问自己：潜在的上升空间有多大？是提高 10%，还是提高 10 倍？我经常看到研究人员承担一些看似合理的项目，但却只能在某些指标上带来微小的改进。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr45k4phvazdc0fexm7e9ed9))
