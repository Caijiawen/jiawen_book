## Highlights
- I think the biggest is to try to ask yourself, what is, like, why might I be wrong? And try to write those down and look at them every day. 
  我认为最大的问题是试着问自己，我为什么会错？并试着写下来，每天看看。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hw0cnhm0mnrpc25texx9k6by))
- well, you still need to keep the Ether exposure or the Bitcoin exposure, because if you don't have the exposure, you are then risking like Ether just doubles and then your yield is kind of pointless, right? 
  你仍然需要保持以太币或比特币的风险敞口，因为如果你没有风险敞口，你就会冒着以太币翻倍的风险，那么你的收益率就毫无意义了，对吗？ ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvx069d91b5s8gqhmmbpy3g6))
- If people are willing to pay you high funding, they have to be making money at some point. If they're not making money, then it's going to be an implosion, like a massive one. So either it's going to be a massive implosion or everybody wins. 
  如果人们愿意向你支付高额资金，他们就必须在某些时候赚钱。如果他们赚不到钱，那么就会出现内爆，比如大规模内爆。所以，要么大面积内爆，要么大家都赢。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvx07krpxybp12v8scqj948v))
- So it's going to die right now. That's why you haven't really seen Olympus Forks do well or Pool 2 games do well.
  12:16
  In general, these kind of crypto mechanism games are just reminding people that it's going to end at some point ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvx0d3ec5c617pqd181x6hhr))
- So points is quite similar where points is like, okay, I'm giving you something, you don't know what it is or you don't know quite how much it's worth, 
  因此，积分也很相似，积分就像是，好吧，我给你一些东西，你不知道它是什么，或者你不知道它值多少钱、 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvx4zfhz4vpghs2aa46fwv5r))
- So that is structurally And like points are often valued off other points, right? So, you know, in the case of like restaking points, like those are, there's probably no genuine demand for it. 
  因此，从结构上来说，积分的价值往往是其他积分的价值，对吧？所以，你知道的，就像重塑积分一样，可能并没有真正的需求。
  18:57
  They can only value it versus like other points, like EtherFi token is live. 
  他们只能将其与其他点进行比较，如 EtherFi 代币是否有效。
  19:01
  And so that gives a, it gives a comparable to value against, but it's very pyramidic in the sense that everything is valuing off one thing, which itself is not very liquid. 
  因此，这就提供了一个估值的参照物，但从所有东西的估值都以一件东西为参照物的意义上讲，这非常具有金字塔性，而这件东西本身的流动性并不强。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvx51j9q81psgcspch7ymfqf))
- Yeah, and with all these pull to quote unquote Ponzi's, the cost to reproduce new ones are so low that if one thing works, then people just keep making new ones. 
  是啊，有了这些引以为豪的庞氏骗局，复制新骗局的成本非常低，只要有一个骗局成功了，人们就会不断制造新的骗局。
  20:44
  And then it dilutes the bid because there's limited amount of capital in crypto. And then, you know, then things start to collapse. 
  然后它就会稀释出价 因为加密货币的资金量有限然后，你知道，事情就开始崩溃了 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvx5609bre3c3deb8jrc7chp))
- I think it's still relatively early to mid cycle. I think that, uh, you know, normies are starting to come down. Uh, and I also think that a lot of, uh, family office money is getting quite interested in crypto, 
  我认为现在还处于周期的早期和中期。我认为，呃，你知道，普通人开始回落。我还认为，很多家族办公室的资金对加密货币很感兴趣、
  21:41
  especially because they don't like the opportunities in tradfi as much, you know, commercial real estate is in trouble. Uh, there's a lot of issues in some emerging markets. And so. I think that that will create a big bid over time. 
  尤其是因为他们不喜欢特拉福德的机会，要知道，商业地产正陷入困境。一些新兴市场问题重重所以我认为，随着时间的推移，这将创造一个大的出价。
  21:59
  I think that retail will probably come a bit later in the cycle. Actually, the meme coin frenzy is still mainly natives playing meme coins. 
  我认为，零售可能会在周期的稍后阶段出现。其实，纪念币的热潮主要还是本国人在玩纪念币。
  22:06
  It's almost like NFT traders playing meme coins and then wealth effects from crypto natives trading meme coins. Because if you even look at the type of meme coins being traded, you ask a man on the street, he doesn't know these memes. 
  这几乎就像是 NFT 交易者在玩纪念币，然后是加密货币原住民交易纪念币带来的财富效应。因为如果你看一下正在交易的纪念币的类型，你在街上问一个人，他都不知道这些纪念币。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvx59fjxnf433ccvh50dmf71))
- And the cycle really is a Solana led cycle now, if we really zoom out a lot. And, you know, it's actually dragged down by other stuff to a large extent. And then it's a Bitcoin ETF cycle as well. 
  如果我们把视线拉得更远一些，现在的周期确实是索拉纳主导的周期。而且，你知道，它实际上在很大程度上被其他东西拖累了。这也是比特币 ETF 的周期。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvx5ds41jndjnsyczsejasxd))
- But the thing is, like, the key is to learn from each time and then make sure you, you, Don't get greedy and try to win back your losses fast. Regroup, figure out what you did wrong, figure out if your process is wrong. 
  但问题是，关键是要从每一次中吸取教训，然后确保自己不要贪心，不要试图快速赢回损失。重整旗鼓，找出你做错了什么，找出你的流程是否有问题。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvx5jq5bnxtsnjm1jprnd02q))
- I've known so many people in crypto who've ground back from losing 90% plus. I know at least a hundred, I think. 
  我认识很多加密货币投资者，他们都从 90% 以上的亏损中恢复过来。我知道至少有上百人吧。
  31:23
  So that's part of the beauty of crypto, which is that it just takes one, especially at smaller sizes, it just takes one or two big ideas to make it all back. You know, it's like the hard times make tough men thing. 
  这就是加密货币的魅力所在，它只需要一个，尤其是在规模较小的情况下，只需要一两个大创意，就能让一切回归正轨。你知道，这就像 "艰难困苦，玉汝于成 "一样。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvx5m56r84tcpgsvbb5dkwaq))
- Because you have to essentially, when you're trading as a market, you're saying the market is mispricing something. So I'm going to do an action. I'm going to risk capital that is trying to prove that the market is wrong. Right.
  33:11
  Whether you're buying or selling. So if you don't have the desire to wager your beliefs versus the common beliefs versus the market beliefs, then you shouldn't even be putting yourself in a position to draw down. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvx5q2cpc15qbdyz94650z55))
- So there is that kind of inherent contradiction in that to create great wealth, you have to Great risk, but to preserve great wealth, you have to take incredible, like you have to have incredible paranoia. 
  因此，要想创造巨大的财富，就必须承担巨大的风险，但要想保住巨大的财富，就必须承担难以置信的风险，比如你必须有难以置信的偏执。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvx5qmth62r79r0m70d62c15))
- So like anything which is less convex, you should try to avoid. So something that's like less convex is like trading like Ether versus Bitcoin or Solana versus Ether or something like that. Like that's not convex. That's for the whales. 
  所以，任何不那么凸的东西，你都应该尽量避免。比如以太币对比特币，索拉纳对以太币之类的交易。那不是凸的。那是为鲸鱼准备的。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvx5v8ek2c0hehkbe2ymrm75))
- It's like I have one analyst that like farmed Jido Soul across I think like 10 wallets, spent like 15 minutes and he got like a 100k airdrop. 
  就像我有一个分析师，他跨越了 10 个钱包，花了 15 分钟就获得了 10 万元的空投。
  39:58
  I was like, oh my God, I was like coping so hard because I can't believe I missed the Jito airdrop. 
  我当时就想，天啊，我简直要崩溃了，因为我竟然错过了智多星的空投。
  40:03
  And then immediately after I saw that, I started to like stake TIA across a bunch of wallets because, I mean, I had no expectations, but I don't have to risk that much capital. 
  看到这个消息后，我马上就开始把 TIA 投到了很多钱包里，因为，我的意思是，我没有任何期望，但我不必冒那么大的资金风险。
  40:11
  I can just spread it across a bunch of wallets and just wait for things to come. And then I got like the Diamond airdrop, which was really big. 
  我可以把钱分散到不同的钱包里，然后静观其变。然后我就得到了钻石空投，真的很大。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvx5yhdn0rxn22zwjghpy07b))
- It's very much needed for convex exposure because to be able to have convexity in your portfolio like that, you have to, ironically, it takes more humility to hold a coin for 100x than to just sell it for 5 or 10x. 
  这对凸面风险敞口来说非常必要，因为要在你的投资组合中实现这样的凸面性，你必须--具有讽刺意味的是--比起以 5 倍或 10 倍的价格出售一枚硬币，以 100 倍的价格持有一枚硬币需要更多的谦逊。
  41:26
  Because if you are very certain that you're like, okay, I know it's top because of these reasons, and then do it. Whereas if you're humble, you may say, I don't I don't, you know, I've already been up on this coin. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvx62pzcq06zxpxwk8348b3p))
- And the thing about the market is that whatever you look for reasons to do something, you always find them. You can look for reasons to either take off or add or close. You can always find those reasons. 
  市场的特点是，无论你寻找什么理由，你总能找到。你可以寻找起飞、加码或平仓的理由。你总能找到这些理由。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvx61rr8h3cjctrmncf4e8z0))
- It's like, it takes very little time, but it takes humility to do so. Because if it was a waste of time, you'd be like, I wasted all my time splitting across 100 wallets. I'm an idiot. But if you're humble, you're like, whatever. 
  这就好比，只需要很少的时间，但却需要谦卑的态度。因为如果这是在浪费时间，你就会说，我浪费了那么多时间，分了 100 个钱包。我是个白痴。但如果你很谦虚，你就会说，随便吧。
  42:39
  Probably a waste of time. Maybe it's not. Just, who cares? Just do it. 
  也许是浪费时间。也许不是。只是，谁在乎呢？做就是了 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvx629yf7m7zwwjc9q2xrqa7))
- I saw a lot of arrogant traders last cycle where they're mainly trading purpose on BitMEX or OKEX. And when DeFi started out, they're like, what is this DeFi shit? It's so small. Like, call me when it's like big. 
  上个周期，我看到很多傲慢的交易者，他们主要在 BitMEX 或 OKEX 上进行目的性交易。而当 DeFi 开始出现时，他们会想，DeFi 是什么鬼东西？它太小了。等它做大了再给我打电话。
  43:01
  And then like, wait a second, you guys all made 100X, right? So, yeah. And so that happens every cycle. Like, whatever you think you're doing is like more important. You know it better. It's a better game. It's all these things. 
  然后，等一下，你们都赚了 100 倍，对吧？没错每个周期都是这样就像，不管你认为你在做什么 就像更重要。你知道它更好。这是一个更好的游戏。就是这些
  43:16
  Probably the small guy that's starting to do it, he's going to mug you quite hard this cycle. It's just quite guaranteed. 
  可能是那个小个子开始这样做了，他会在这个周期狠狠地打劫你。这是肯定的 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvx63fgf6q1r3m9ax8zee22b))
- So that that few versus many is a thing you have to always think about. Like, like, for example, like if you buy ETH into the merge, like you are now very much part of the many. 
  因此，少数对多数是你必须时刻考虑的问题。举个例子，如果你在合并时购买了 ETH，那么你现在就在很大程度上成为了 "多数 "的一部分。
  44:53
  The people who like bought ETH like six months before the merge, they're going to sell them to you because they did everything the same as you, except that they did it before you. Right. 
  那些在合并前六个月就买了 ETH 的人，他们会把 ETH 卖给你，因为他们做的一切都和你一样，只不过他们比你做得更早。没错
  45:03
  So you don't want to give that kind of like time edge to people. You want to be in the time edge. You want to be on the razor's blade of the time edge. And that makes all the difference. Timing is everything. 
  因此，你不希望给人们带来时间上的优势。你要在时间的边缘。你要站在时间边缘的刀锋上。这就是区别所在。时间就是一切。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvx7van8hbfaywb1ffawvjev))
- The narrative expansion range of things is important. I think that it's an art, not a science. I think a quite obvious one, a way to think about it is, as it goes up, will more people believe in it or not? If yes, then that can expand. 
  扩大叙事范围很重要。我认为这是一门艺术，而不是科学。我认为，一个相当明显的思考方式是，当它上升时，是否会有更多的人相信它？如果是，那就可以扩展。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvx8g1atfn3tx6hmbdky3r81))
- But in general, there is a huge alpha in buying before the exchange liquidity, because there's a whole set of people who buy new coins when they come out as a Pascal's wager. 
  但总的来说，在交易所流通之前买入会有巨大的阿尔法收益，因为有一大批人会在新币上市时买入，作为帕斯卡尔的赌注。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvx8jr12dv1d69tysdj42866))
- It's more that after the price moves, we then search, grasp a narrative to explain it. And that's in the structure of the human mind, because the mind is actually incapable of forming a narrative without a stimulus. 
  更重要的是，在价格变动之后，我们会寻找、掌握一种叙事方法来解释它。而这正是人类的思维结构所决定的，因为在没有刺激的情况下，思维实际上是无法形成叙述的。
  58:42
  Stimulus is response, right? So if we see something happen, then we try to explain what happened. We try to rationalize that. If nothing happened, there's nothing to rationalize. 
  刺激就是反应，对吗？所以，如果我们看到发生了什么，我们就会试图解释发生了什么。我们试图将其合理化。如果什么都没发生，那就没什么好合理化的了。
  58:52
  So knowing that, then there's opportunities to create the narrative, right? So that's why, you know, after the ETH whales buy the ETH, then they say, okay, well, here's why you need to buy it, because the merger is coming. Right. 
  知道了这一点，就有机会创造叙事，对吧？所以，这就是为什么，你知道，在ETH鲸鱼买下ETH之后，他们会说，好吧，这就是为什么你需要买下它，因为合并就要来了。对吧。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvx8p10drcedsjg1kj99hzgf))
- There are so many examples from 2017, 18, where like, you know, like the Zcash, I don't know if you were around much then, but like, you know, remember there was a Zcash fork. It was a hybrid fork. That's done by a guy named Rhett. 
  2017 年、18 年有很多这样的例子，比如 Zcash，我不知道你当时是否也在，但你知道，记得有一个 Zcash 分叉。这是一个混合分叉。那是一个叫雷特的人做的。
  59:32
  He was going to airdrop to Bitcoin and Zcash, called ZClassic. He's going to fork out the team allocation. But this thing did really well up until the day of the fork. And then on the day of, it just completely died. Died in about two days. 
  他打算空投比特币和 Zcash，名为 ZClassic。他要分叉出团队分配。但这东西在分叉前一直表现很好分叉当天，它就彻底死了两天就死了
  59:49
  Down like 90%. It was very, very hype. So reflexivity matters a lot. Think about how you create that kind of. And that's more from the point of view of like as a creator of narrative, I think. 
  下跌了 90%。这是非常非常大的炒作。因此，反思性非常重要。想想你是如何创作的我认为，这更多的是从作为叙事创作者的角度出发。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvx8pbbnamqatdnf4gbwkhrz))
- I think another great influence, probably Paul Tudor Jones, like I watched this trader documentary quite a bit in the other days that helped a lot. And he has the concept of like. You have to bring high energy to whatever you do. 
  我觉得另一个对我影响很大的人，可能是保罗-都铎-琼斯（Paul Tudor Jones），就像我前几天看的这部交易者纪录片，对我帮助很大。他的理念是：无论做什么事，你都要精力充沛。
  1:00:20
  You have to treat it like a sport. So they would show him trading at 3 a.m. currencies on the phone. They would show him really analyzing the charts very athletically, being like, okay, this, that, this, that. 
  你必须把它当成一项运动。因此，他们会让他在凌晨 3 点打电话交易货币。他们会展示他非常运动地分析图表，就像，好吧，这个，那个，这个，那个。
  1:00:33
  I think that's actually important. So if you're a directional trader, you have to be actually relatively Being like a pugnacious person almost, I think that that's required. 
  我认为这一点很重要。因此，如果你是一个方向性交易者，你就必须像一个斗志昂扬的人，我认为这是必须的。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvx8q70tbyhv9psf29rwnzah))
- I mean, I've read all the Market Wizards books actually before I started Three Arrows and that was actually one of my biggest reasons why I started the fund because I just thought, you know, it's actually not that hard. 
  我的意思是，其实在创办 Three Arrows 基金之前，我已经读过所有《市场奇才》的书，这也是我创办基金的最大原因之一，因为我觉得，你知道，这其实并不难。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvx8qk2ab7g5xnvfpp10mv4e))
- And so it's like, it's something where Crypto is powerful in that if you tweet good stuff, whales will DM you it and ask you why you think that. 
  因此，加密货币的强大之处就在于，如果你在推特上发了好东西，鲸鱼就会给你发 DM，问你为什么这么想。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvx8w1tsgqgnc3c4yhje0eva))
- Like, I think that 95% of people on CT, they're genuinely trying to learn and they're trying to share thoughts. They're trying to show you their bags, but they're also trying to learn which bags to buy. 
  我认为，CT 上 95% 的人都是真心实意地想学习，想分享自己的想法。他们试图向你展示他们的包包，但他们也试图了解该买哪些包包。
  1:06:49
  And I think that in almost all cases, like, Reading CT selectively will make you a better trader. The problem comes when people start to use it for too much socializing and not enough like actual knowledge harvesting. 
  我认为，几乎在所有情况下，有选择地阅读 CT 都会让你成为更好的交易者。问题在于，人们开始过多地利用它来进行社交活动，而不是真正地收获知识。
  1:07:10
  I think that when it goes more into socializing, then you have to make sure that you are getting out of it something that is improving your trading and investing. 
  我认为，当社交活动越来越多时，你必须确保你从中得到的东西能改善你的交易和投资。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvx8wtw2qh6kpjnvfef2s157))
- I said to the guy, hey, follow my Twitter. I'm trying to build it up. I have 800 followers. So when we have 800, then each person I met, I was just like, follow my Twitter, because that's like one plus one each time, right? 
  我对他说，嘿，关注我的推特。我正在努力建立它。我有 800 个粉丝。所以，当我们有了 800 个粉丝后，我遇到的每个人都会关注我的 Twitter，因为每次都是一加一，对吧？ ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvx8yf02ymh1xv10j07pwnfr))
- I think at its core is talent. I think I'm very good at identifying talent. So last cycle, actually, most of the best ideas are not even, let's say, originally my ideas. 
  我认为其核心是人才。我认为我非常善于发现人才。因此，在上一个周期，实际上，大多数最好的想法甚至可以说最初都不是我的想法。
  1:12:57
  It's just that I hear about it, we discuss it, and then we do it together. That was true for DeFi. Arthur Chang and Andrew Kang really brought me into DeFi with synthetics and then later on with Wi-Fi. 
  我只是听说，我们讨论，然后一起做。DeFi 也是如此。亚瑟-张（Arthur Chang）和安德鲁-康（Andrew Kang）将我带入了DeFi的合成技术领域，后来又带我进入了Wi-Fi领域。
  1:13:15
  With Grayscale as well, we did the trade in the right sizing, but the idea generation comes from other people. 
  灰度》也是如此，我们在正确的尺寸上做了交易，但创意来自其他人。
  1:13:25
  I'm a big believer in young people because I think that in general, if there's a room of people, the youngest one probably actually is the highest alpha. 
  我非常相信年轻人，因为我认为，一般来说，如果一个房间里有很多人，最年轻的那个人实际上可能是最高的阿尔法。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvx92gchz2n02tcfkjw66m5f))
- And I think what they miss is that It's a new game, right? New games, people don't know the rules. So you can't ask the old game players to learn the new game usually, especially if they have money. 
  我觉得他们忽略了这是个新游戏，对吧？新游戏，人们不知道规则。所以你不能要求旧游戏的玩家学习新游戏，尤其是在他们有钱的情况下。
  1:19:31
  Like the wealthier they are, the less likely they are to learn new things, right? 
  就像他们越富有，就越不可能学习新东西，对吗？ ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvy0cn7geh7pq810q2dh32qs))
- I mean, CZ failed four times before he started Binance. So it's something where having that experience and having that always learning mentality can come naturally to you when you start being grateful for what you have. 
  我的意思是，CZ 在创办 Binance 之前失败了四次。因此，当你开始对自己所拥有的一切心存感激时，拥有这样的经验和不断学习的心态就会自然而然地产生。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvy0jpq4zmpg5ptpwxbzw27v))
