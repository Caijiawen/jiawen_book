- Summary: Building a Second Brain is a methodology for organizing and accessing ideas, inspirations, and insights in order to unlock creative potential. It involves capturing important information, organizing it in a digital environment, distilling key insights, and expressing ideas effectively. By offloading our thinking onto a Second Brain, we free up our biological brain to be more present and creative. The four-step method of CODE (Capture, Organize, Distill, and Express) provides a flexible framework for building and working with a Second Brain. The first step, Capture, involves capturing the most important ideas and insights worth saving in a centralized place.

## Highlights
- Capture only the most important information 
  只捕捉最重要的信息 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmncythfp86kts89v2wxa68x))
- The first step in building a Second Brain is **“capturing” the ideas and insights you think are worth saving**. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmncz09zhj38wxvkqvay5zgm))
- We are already consuming or producing this information, **we just need to keep it in a single, centralized place**, such as a digital notetaking app like Evernote, Microsoft OneNote, Notion, Apple Notes, Obsidian or others. These apps facilitate capturing small “snippets” of text as well as hyperlinks, images, webpages, screenshots, PDFs, and other attachments, all of which are saved permanently and synced across all your devices.

- Too often, we just passively react to the information that’s been shoved in front of us by other people and algorithms.  
  很多时候，我们只是被动地对其他人和算法推到我们面前的信息做出反应。
  **How do you escape this reactivity loop? 
  如何摆脱这种反应性循环？** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmnd27weeh8cmde2a7y3zpnx))
- **Read-later apps** such as [Readwise’s Reader](https://readwise.io/tiago), [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com/), or [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/en/) are designed for this particular purpose.  As you begin to collect content, you’ll be able to choose which sources to consume in a deliberate way. 
  Readwise's Reader、Instapaper 或 Pocket 等 "稍后阅读 "应用程序就是为此而设计的。 当你开始收集内容时，就可以有意识地选择要阅读的内容。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmnd325vdq4zvk3r6chackkg))
- Keep only what resonates 只保留有共鸣的东西
  ![Capture what resonates with you](https://fortelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/13-Capture-What-Resonates.png)
  The word “capturing” often brings to mind an analytical way of thinking. But analysis is time-consuming and tiring. In deciding which passages, images, theories, or quotes to keep, **don’t make it a highly intellectual, analytical decision.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmnd3pwnrw8vr72b1a4c2f5x))
- Instead, your rule of thumb should be to **save anything that “resonates” with you on an intuitive level.**  
  相反，你的经验法则应该是保存任何能在直觉层面上与你产生 "共鸣 "的东西。
  This is often because it connects to something you care about, wonder about, or find inherently intriguing. By training ourselves to notice when something resonates with us at a deeper level, we improve not only our ability to see opportunities, but also our understanding of ourselves and how we work. 
  这通常是因为它与你所关心的、想知道的或觉得内在有趣的事物有关。通过训练自己在某件事情引起我们更深层次的共鸣时注意到它，我们不仅能提高洞察机遇的能力，还能提高对自己和工作方式的认识。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmnd4p3n6gasr3zhcs10qqh3))
- **The best way to organize your notes is to focus on your active projects.** When you encounter new information, think about how it can help you move forward something you’re currently working on. 
  整理笔记的最佳方法是将重点放在正在进行的项目上。遇到新信息时，想想它如何能帮助你推进正在进行的工作。
  Surprisingly, focussing on taking action, will also **help you combat information overwhelm**. There are relatively few things that are actionable and relevant at any given time, which makes it easier to ignore everything else.

- Distill down to the essence 
  提炼精华 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmndb2nw4e0hbq4xjrj6tqba))
- You can greatly facilitate and speed up this process by **distilling your notes into actionable, bite-sized summaries.** 
  您可以将笔记提炼为可操作的小结，从而极大地促进和加快这一过程。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmndbdhk6gjbmw2q1e3jmtpx))

- Don’t just consume information passively – put it to use 
  不要只是被动地获取信息 - 要学以致用 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmndjbg1h1jj6ey88vnngseq))
- But information only becomes knowledge – something personal, embodied, grounded – when we put it to use. That’s why we should **shift as much of our effort as possible from consuming information, to creating new things.** The things we create – whether they are writing pieces, websites, photographs, videos, or live performances – embody and express the knowledge we’ve gained from personal experience. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmndjv8hxtac9jve3vebf66n))
- Instead of trying to sit down and move the entire project forward all at once, which is like trying to roll a giant boulder uphill, a more effective approach is to **end each work session – whether it is 15 minutes or 3 hours – by completing just one Intermediate Packet.**  
  与其试图坐下来一次性推进整个项目，就像试图把一块巨石滚上山，不如采用一种更有效的方法，即在每次工作会议结束时，不管是 15 分钟还是 3 小时，只完成一个中间包。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmndkgs19an3xctqzpjswzb1))
