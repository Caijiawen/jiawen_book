- Category: #articles
- Summary: The Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) has officially launched on the Avalanche, Ethereum, Optimism, and Polygon blockchains. CCIP is a secure and reliable protocol that allows for cross-chain interactions and transfers of tokens and assets. Leading DeFi protocols such as Synthetix and Aave are already adopting CCIP, and it is being used by companies like Swift and financial institutions for cross-chain connectivity in capital markets. CCIP offers features like simplified token transfers, programmable token transfers, rate limits, smart execution, and timelocked upgradability. The protocol also supports fee payments in LINK and alternative assets, with plans for automated on-chain conversion.

## Highlights
- Developers, applications, and enterprises can use CCIP to unlock a variety of use cases, such as:
  • **Cross-chain tokenized assets**: Transfer tokens across blockchains from a single interface and without having to build your own bridge solution.
  • **Cross-chain collateral**: Launch cross-chain lending applications that allow users to deposit collateral on one blockchain and borrow assets on another.
  • **Cross-chain liquid staking tokens:** Bridge liquid staking tokens across multiple blockchains to increase their utilization in DeFi apps on other chains.
  • **Cross-chain NFTs:** Give users the ability to mint an NFT on a source blockchain and receive it on a destination blockchain.
  • **Cross-chain account abstraction:** Build smart contract wallets with native CCIP capabilities to improve the user experience of making cross-chain function calls. For instance, enable users to approve transactions on any chain using a single wallet.
  • **Cross-chain gaming:** Create blockchain-agnostic gaming experiences that enable players to store high-value items on more secure blockchains while playing on more scalable blockchains.
  • **Cross-chain data storage and computation:** Employ data storage solutions that enable users to store arbitrary data on a destination chain and execute computations on it using a transaction on a source chain. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hks4r6y1cygs7pns9423tcsw))
