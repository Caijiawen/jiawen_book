- Full Title: Deep Dive into Celestia (TIA) with CEO Mustafa Al-Bassam
- Category: #articles
- Summary: Celestia Labs CEO Mustafa Al-Bassam discussed the concept of Celestia, a blockchain platform that focuses on data availability. He explained that Celestia is a minimal blockchain that allows developers to post arbitrary data onto the chain, without executing transactions or smart contracts. The platform aims to provide a simple and scalable solution for building cryptocurrency applications, with the actual execution happening off-chain on rollup chains. Al-Bassam also discussed his passion for decentralization and his background in ethical hacking. He highlighted the power of technology in redistributing power and how it has influenced his interest in cryptocurrency.

## Highlights
- Ship an MVP (Minimum Viable Product). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hna52e64dxqc5nd1gvrjtq9p))
- • The speaker was involved with hacking groups like Anonymous and LC.
  • They hacked into the emails of a Federal contractor and exposed wrongdoing.
  • This experience made them realize the power of using technology to redistribute power. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn9yj1bc8t4mv1ngaa7v5rf3))
- • Celestia was formerly called Lazy Ledger, which is a very lazy blockchain.
  • Lazy Ledger is a blockchain where developers can only dump arbitrary data without any computation or smart contracts.
  • Lazy Ledger is still useful for developers to build cryptocurrency applications.
  • Lazy Ledger can be used as a base layer for off-chain execution, such as rollups.
  • The idea of modularity in Lazy Ledger separates consensus from computation, allowing developers to define their own execution environments on top of it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn9ykhz4jvakag3t1j03ncq0))
- • Modular blockchain is a concept where certain components of a blockchain are outsourced to another blockchain.
  • There are four main components in a modular blockchain: consensus, data availability, settlement, and execution.
  • Rollup is an example of a modular blockchain as it outsources data availability to another chain.
  • Celestia is also a modular blockchain as it outsources computation execution to Ropsten. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn9ysce05k0yxvp60bn8gqk3))
- Monolithic chains, which aim to do everything, have been rejected by the market in favor of a multi-chain ecosystem. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn9z06fkf3f402tmg85vv56q))
- Modalism aims to overcome maximalism and provide flexibility to developers. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn9z0xvgj3ycxq4pf54zntv2))
- • Light nodes have low resource requirements, such as 25 kilobytes per second of bandwidth and a few gigabytes of disk space.
  • Light nodes can be run on mobile phones and other devices with low resources.
  • Light nodes should provide almost the same level of security as full nodes. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn9z4ntx5t0xh9f8cvx1egc7))
