- Summary: I do an exercise called “fear-setting” at least once a quarter, often once a month.

- This all equated to a significant realization: There was practically no risk, only huge life-changing upside potential, and I could resume my previous course without any more effort than I was already putting forth. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3vb545r4gw6qcp6avv48yek))
- “Set aside a certain number of days, during which you shall be content with the scantiest and cheapest fare, with coarse and rough dress, saying to yourself the while: “Is this the condition that I feared?” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3va1qw53crmd4d2rbyev1wz))
- Then a funny thing happened. In my undying quest to make myself miserable, I accidentally began to backpedal. As soon as I cut through the vague unease and ambiguous anxiety by defining my nightmare, the worst-case scenario, I wasn’t as worried about taking a trip. Suddenly, I started thinking of simple steps I could take to salvage my remaining resources and get back on track if all hell struck at once. I could always take a temporary bartending job to pay the rent if I had to. I could sell some furniture and cut back on eating out. I could steal lunch money from the kindergarteners who passed by my apartment every morning. The options were many. I realized it wouldn’t be that hard to get back to where I was, let alone survive. None of these things would be fatal—not even close. Mere panty pinches on the journey of life. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3va6nckez1cvwj02z6zq5tm))
- I realized that on a scale of 1–10, 1 being nothing and 10 being permanently life-changing, my so-called worst-case scenario might have a temporary impact of 3 or 4. I believe this is true of most people and most would-be “holy sh*t, my life is over” disasters. 
  我意识到，在1-10的范围内，1代表什么都没有，10代表永久改变生活，我所谓的最坏情况可能只有3或4的暂时影响。我相信大多数人和大多数可能发生的 "该死的，我的生活完蛋了 "的灾难都是如此。
  Keep in mind that this is the one-in-a-million disaster nightmare. 
  请记住，这是百万分之一的灾难恶梦。
  On the other hand, if I realized my best-case scenario, or even a probable-case scenario, it would easily have a permanent 9 or 10 positive life-changing effect. 
  另一方面，如果我实现了我最好的情况，甚至是可能的情况，它将很容易产生一个永久的9或10个积极的改变生活的效果。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3va7pvt9ngb2cj7xb4mnzvw))
- In other words, I was risking an unlikely and temporary 3 or 4 for a probable and permanent 9 or 10, and I could easily recover my baseline workaholic prison with a bit of extra work if I wanted to. 
  换句话说，我是在冒着不太可能的、暂时的3或4分的风险来换取可能的、永久的9或10分，如果我愿意的话，我可以用一点额外的工作轻松地恢复我的基本工作狂监狱。
  This all equated to a significant realization: There was practically no risk, only huge life-changing upside potential, and I could resume my previous course without any more effort than I was already putting forth. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3vahy1nrnapcbd41c1xgshe))
- Uncovering Fear Disguised as Optimism 
  揭开伪装成乐观主义的恐惧面纱
  **“There’s no difference between a pessimist who says, ‘Oh, it’s hopeless, so don’t bother doing anything,’ and an optimist who says, ‘Don’t bother doing anything, it’s going to turn out fine any way.’ Either way, nothing happens.” 
  "一个悲观主义者说，'哦，没希望了，所以不要费力气做任何事'，和一个乐观主义者说，'不要费力气做任何事，无论如何都会有好结果'，这两者之间没有区别。无论哪种方式，都不会发生什么。"

- 定义你的噩梦，如果你做了你正在考虑的事情，可能发生的绝对最坏的情况。当你考虑你可以或需要做出的重大改变时，会有哪些疑问、恐惧和 "如果 "出现？仔细地设想一下。这将是你生命的终结吗？如果有的话，在1-10的范围内，会有什么永久性影响？这些事情真的是永久性的吗？你认为它们真正发生的可能性有多大？ ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h419qmgrnfz4rn8remdd7fse))
- 你可以采取什么措施来修复损害或让事情重新开始，即使是暂时的？机会是，这比你想象的要容易。你如何能让事情重新得到控制？ ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h419sd2cx7phfd4shwej6fxb))
