## Highlights
- Napping has benefits such as improved cognition, emotional health, and decision-making, but the optimal nap duration is around 20 minutes to avoid grogginess upon waking. 
  午睡有改善认知、情绪健康和决策等益处，但最佳午睡时间为 20 分钟左右，以避免醒来后昏昏沉沉。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvth43jdmdpvh8jcmzs83yjs))
- Cold hands and face washing can be used to enhance wakefulness, and a combination of napping, caffeine, cold exposure, and bright light may have an even more potent effect. 
  冷手和洗脸可以用来提高清醒度，而午睡、咖啡因、冷暴露和强光的组合可能会有更强的效果。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvth4re5cx3a6nj9hr6vp62p))
- Do what I do is when I wake up in the morning, I consume about 16 to 32 ounces of water and I'll dissolve a packet of element in that water. I'll also do the same when I exercise, especially if it's on a hot day and I'm sweating a lot. 
  我所做的是，当我早上醒来时，我会喝大约 16 到 32 盎司的水，并将一包元素溶解在水中。当我锻炼时我也会这样做，特别是在大热天而且我出汗很多的时候。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvr0zvh1s027ps50nqn4wqq2))
- Sleep is now happening more dominantly in the night phase of the 24-hour cycle. And there are fewer bouts of sleep during the daytime. Then perhaps by the time you're in kindergarten, you may be down to just two sleeps. 
  现在，睡眠更多地发生在 24 小时周期的夜间阶段。而且白天的睡眠次数也较少。然后，也许到你上幼儿园的时候，你的睡眠时间可能会减少到只有两次。

  So now we've switched from polyphasic sleep as infants to biphasic sleep as kindergarten. 
  所以现在我们已经从婴儿时期的多相睡眠转变为幼儿园时的双相睡眠。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvr14n9cp14rtbtmj6hs7k7t))
- because I know, like me, you love, you know, the whole variety of species. But you've got elephants who will sleep as little as four hours and then you've got the little brown bat who is the rock star of sleep. 
  因为我知道，就像我一样，你爱所有种类的物种。但是大象的睡眠时间只有四个小时，还有小棕色蝙蝠，它是睡眠的摇滚明星。

  And it will sleep almost 17 to 18 hours a day. It nudges out the sloth in that sense. 
  而且它每天会睡差不多17到18个小时。从这个意义上说，它把树懒赶走了。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvr182tf1v5h9j5jas6dzhap))
- What we've discovered is that REM sleep acts as an electrical fertilizer to stimulate the growth of these connections within the brain. 
  我们发现，快速眼动睡眠就像一种电肥料，刺激大脑内这些连接的生长。

  It's almost as though you could think about an internet service provider with this huge new neighborhood. And the first call of business is to go in and wire up each one of those homes with these fiber optic cables. 
  就好像您可以想象一家拥有这个巨大新社区的互联网服务提供商一样。第一个任务就是走进每个家庭，用这些光缆连接起来。
  17:25
  That's what REM sleep is doing. And if you start to deprive, and these were studies done many years ago by Howard Rothwalk and others, if you deprive animals of REM sleep, you stunt the developmental growth of the brain. 
  这就是快速眼动睡眠的作用。如果你开始剥夺动物的快速眼动睡眠，这些是霍华德·罗斯沃克和其他人多年前所做的研究，如果你剥夺动物的快速眼动睡眠，你就会阻碍大脑的发育。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvr1ahck4fpzgtydm5vh084w))
- So about 20% of the time that you're asleep will be REM sleep and the remaining time will be, 80% of that time will be non-REM sleep. 
  因此，您入睡时大约 20% 的时间将处于快速眼动睡眠状态，而其余时间中 80% 的时间将处于非快速眼动睡眠状态。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvr1c6s95b0a9xd4rkmw5435))
- So coming back to biphasic sleep, I described one version once we are adults, which is the siesta-like notion, one long bout at night, short about during the day. 
  因此，回到双相睡眠，我描述了我们成年后的一个版本，这是类似午睡的概念，晚上长时间睡眠，白天短暂睡眠。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvr2p6wtmst7sftje67j8yx1))
- So there are certainly many benefits and we've looked downstairs in the body, blood pressure, cardiovascular measures, immune health. They all seem to benefit. So at that point, everyone may be thinking, of course, this sounds good. 
  所以肯定有很多好处，我们已经在身体、血压、心血管措施、免疫健康等方面进行了研究。他们似乎都受益了。所以在这一点上，每个人可能都会想，当然，这听起来不错。

  Not to mention the basics, which is your attention, your concentration, your focus and your energy all improve by way of naps. Even your decision-making. 
  更不用说基础知识了，你的注意力、集中力、集中力和精力都可以通过小睡来提高。甚至你的决策。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvr3v0qnb7xdywv4259w7v16))
