## Highlights
- This section focuses on the basics of sleep hygiene, which are tools rather than rules to improve sleep. The first edict is regularity, going to bed and waking up at the same time every day to anchor sleep and improve its quantity and quality. The second edict is darkness, as we are a dark-deprived society and need darkness at night to release melatonin. The third edict is coolness, as our body temperature needs to drop by about two degrees Fahrenheit to initiate sleep. The fourth edict is quietness, as noise can disrupt sleep. The fifth edict is no caffeine six hours before bed, as caffeine has a half-life of six hours and can interfere with sleep. 
  本节重点介绍睡眠卫生的基本知识，这是改善睡眠的工具而非规则。第一条规则是规律性，每天在同一时间上床睡觉和起床，以巩固睡眠并提高睡眠的数量和质量。第二条是黑暗，因为我们是一个缺乏黑暗的社会，晚上需要黑暗来释放褪黑激素。第三道指令是凉爽，因为我们的体温需要下降约两华氏度才能启动睡眠。第四个原则是安静，因为噪音会扰乱睡眠。第五个原则是睡前六小时不摄入咖啡因，因为咖啡因的半衰期为六小时，会干扰睡眠。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxc9nsvqfmnyf6m8nve47qsk))
- 酒精会破坏睡眠，导致频繁觉醒，而这种觉醒往往不被察觉。此外，酒精还会阻碍快速眼动睡眠，而快速眼动睡眠对学习、记忆和情绪调节至关重要。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxc9s3gvn18kjwszrzgjc56z))
- 咖啡因的半衰期约为 5 到 6 小时，这意味着 5 到 6 小时后，约 50%的咖啡因仍在血液中循环，从而影响大脑。这意味着，即使您在下午摄入咖啡因，它仍然会影响您晚上的睡眠。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxc9w68zx9g1ycw6rr0hf61w))
- Very interesting. As somebody who wakes up in the middle of the night and sometimes has trouble getting back to sleep, that resonates. I have no trouble falling asleep whatsoever. Knock on wood. 
  非常有趣。作为一个半夜醒来，有时又难以入睡的人，这一点很有共鸣。我入睡完全没有问题。敲敲木头
  18:09
  I'm superstitious about this at this point, but I use tools like non-sleep deep rest, yoga nidra, long exhale breathing. I think these wake up Episode seemed to happen more when I'm processing a lot of stuff from my daily life. That's right. 
  在这一点上我很迷信，但我使用了一些工具，比如非睡眠深度休息、瑜伽冥想、长呼气呼吸等。我觉得当我在处理日常生活中的很多事情时，这些唤醒事件似乎发生得更多一些。没错，就是这样。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvtk9s0dn428v1nas1n1t2g4))
- and it's just a rule of thumb, about 20, 25 minutes, if you can't fall back asleep or you can't fall asleep, it's okay. Just say, tonight is not my night. It's not a problem. Tomorrow is not completely shot. It's fine. 
  这只是经验之谈，大概20到25分钟 如果你睡不着或者睡不着，没关系就说，今晚不是我的夜晚。没问题明天也不是完全没戏。没事的
  21:00
  I'm just going to get up, get out of bed. If you can, if you're lucky enough, try to go to a different room and in dim light, read a book, listen to a podcast, whatever it is that relaxes you, just do that. 
  我只是要起床，下床。如果可以，如果你足够幸运，试着去另一个房间，在昏暗的灯光下，读一本书，听一个播客，不管是什么，只要能让你放松，就去做。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvtkchysc683047m9tvbjqfg))
- And another piece is that I've always felt that when I get out of bed in the middle of the night because I can't sleep and I go to the sofa, I often can sleep very well. Proving, proving, right? It's a control experiment. 
  还有一点是，我一直觉得，当我半夜因为睡不着而从床上爬起来，走到沙发上时，我往往能睡得很香。证明，证明，对吗？这是一个对照实验。
  28:07
  Proving that the location of sleep is And the association of wakefulness and sleep in bed as opposed to on the sofa is a clear component. And this is in an environment that's of equal temperature. 
  证明了睡眠的地点，以及在床上和沙发上的清醒和睡眠的关联是一个明显的组成部分。而这是在温度相同的环境中进行的。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvtm6jbrj8jae2xwk8b1222a))
- It's related to sleep or at least the opportunity to sleep. Sometimes even I've heard from some people, and there's no studies or data on this, Even turning yourself around now, this is hard if you have a partner in bed, 
  这与睡眠有关，至少与睡眠的机会有关。有时，我甚至从一些人那里听说，没有这方面的研究或数据，即使现在把自己转过来，如果你有一个伴侣在床上，这也很难、
  29:13
  but you just switch top to bottom of the bed and you take your pillow and you pull the duvet all the way down and you put the pillow at the opposite end where your feet used to be and you get into bed. 
  但你只需把床的上端换到下端，然后拿着枕头，把羽绒被往下拉，再把枕头放在原来放脚的另一端，然后就上床睡觉了。
  29:24
  And even just looking around and sort of having a difference, that alone is so subtle, but it can make a real difference. So, again, just keep these things in mind. 
  哪怕只是环顾四周，看看有什么不同，这本身就很微妙，但却能带来真正的不同。所以，请再次牢记这些事情。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvtn9ms9hzk1gad9sh0p6zfr))
- Okay, so just to make sure that I have The basic list of sleep hygiene factors, correct? I have regularity is king. 
  好吧，为了确保我掌握了睡眠卫生因素的基本清单，对吗？我有规律才是王道。
  1:12:14
  Speaker 1 发言人 1
  Yep. 是的。
  1:12:15
  Andrew Huberman 安德鲁-休伯曼
  Light and dark, meaning that one should optimize or at least seek to optimize their exposure to light in the morning and throughout the day and then in the evening to make things dim and dark. 
  光和暗，指的是人们应该优化或至少设法优化早晨和全天的光照，然后在晚上让光线变得昏暗。
  1:12:27
  Speaker 1 发言人 1
  Yes. 是的。
  1:12:29
  Andrew Huberman 安德鲁-休伯曼
  Temperature, and there you have a little, it's not a mantra, but what is it? It's a warm up to cool down to fall asleep, and then it's stay cool, like Fonzie, stay cool to stay asleep, and then a warm up to wake up. 
  温度，你有一个小的，它不是一个口头禅，但它是什么？从热身到降温再到入睡，然后是保持凉爽，就像方兹一样，保持凉爽才能入睡，然后再热身才能醒来。
  1:12:47
  Speaker 1 发言人 1
  Yeah, and we will come on to that I think in a little while again. 
  是的，我想过一会儿我们会继续讨论这个问题。
  1:12:50
  Andrew Huberman 安德鲁-休伯曼
  Then there's walk it out, which is if I understand correctly, if you're trying to fall asleep or fall back asleep, and it's taking you longer than about 20-25 minutes, you should just get out of bed and go elsewhere in the house, 
  然后是 "走出去"，如果我没理解错的话，就是如果你想入睡或继续入睡，而花费的时间超过了 20-25 分钟，你就应该下床到房子的其他地方去、
  1:13:01
  do something else, maybe even lie down on a different surface in the house to try and see if you can sleep there. 
  做一些其他的事情，甚至可以躺在屋子里不同的地方，试试看你是否能在那里入睡。
  1:13:06
  But don't stay in bed, don't create a paired association of wakefulness and your Bed because that can lead to problems in subsequent nights. 
  但不要躺在床上，不要把清醒和床联系在一起，因为这样会给以后的夜晚带来麻烦。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvtrpj0b532epkbcdqetrje2))
- The first one I would say is that if you are struggling with sleep and you have had a bad night of sleep, the first recommendation is do nothing. 
  我想说的第一点是，如果你正在为睡眠而苦恼，而且昨晚睡得很不好，那么第一个建议就是什么都不要做。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvtrya5dwdw8axnqw0z295m1))
- My recommendation would be after that bad night of sleep, hold out for as long as you can, as close to your natural bedtime as possible. Then go to sleep and you'll give yourself highest chance of success. Don't over-caffeinate. 
  我的建议是，在一夜失眠后，尽可能坚持到自然入睡时间。然后再去睡觉，这样你会给自己最大的成功机会。不要过度摄入咖啡因。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvtryxq1t9h9r55ns63f7r4k))
- Terrific. So if you don't sleep that well, do your best to still get some exercise, but just be mindful of the fact that, you know, in the winter months, especially that might, if you go too hard in the gym or on a run, 
  好极了所以，如果你睡得不好，最好还是多做一些运动，但要注意的是，你知道，在冬季，尤其是如果你在健身房或跑步时太用力的话，可能会影响到你的睡眠质量、 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvts3b5z4t5kv5xnbs03qqa2))
- I think there's something about the human brain that we don't do well in unrestrained systems that I really think guardrails are fantastic. I love deadlines, for instance. 
  我认为人脑的某些特性决定了我们无法在无拘无束的系统中很好地工作，因此我真的认为护栏非常棒。例如，我喜欢最后期限。
  1:31:45
  Yeah, discipline is essentially the- Hard deadlines, or as they say in academia, because we write grants all the time, drop deadlines, which who made up that term? But if you don't make it, that's it. 
  是啊，纪律本质上就是--苛刻的最后期限，或者就像学术界说的那样，因为我们一直在写基金，所以就叫 "放弃最后期限"，这个词是谁造出来的？但如果你没赶上，那就完了。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvts57vj1vbeevvn5rymxrbx))
- If you are not into meditation or podcasts or sleep stories or whatever it is that you wish for, try taking yourself on a mental walk. And it has to be a walk that you know very well. 
  如果你不喜欢冥想、播客、睡眠故事或其他任何你想要的东西，那就试着带自己去散散心吧。而且必须是你非常熟悉的散步。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvts78vhns51bxrp3rg7sjmk))
- One of the mechanisms separate from that, well, it's related to that. If you look at teen phone use, one of the reasons that they don't sleep very well at night is that they're constantly checking their phones because of FOMO, 
  与此相反的一个机制与此有关。如果你看一下青少年使用手机的情况，他们晚上睡不好的原因之一就是他们因为 "FOMO "而不停地查看手机、
  1:39:20
  a fear of missing out, what has gone on as I've been asleep. And it's stunning the data. 
  在我睡着的时候，我害怕错过发生了什么。这些数据令人震惊。
  1:39:25
  But for most adults, the other reason I don't like advocating for phone use When your alarm goes off in the morning, what is the first thing that you do as you're in bed? 
  但是，对于大多数成年人来说，我不喜欢提倡使用手机的另一个原因是 当早晨闹钟响起时，你躺在床上做的第一件事是什么？
  1:39:37
  You swipe right or you unlock your phone and you instantly start checking social media, emails, text messages. And this tsunami of stress and anxiety just floods over you. It hits you like this wall of anxiety. 
  你向右滑动或解锁手机，就会立即开始查看社交媒体、电子邮件和短信。压力和焦虑的海啸就这样淹没了你。它就像一堵焦虑的墙一样向你袭来。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvtsh003j3gvr4hgwz8p1ayz))
- So they started to stimulate the brain, inputting these stimulation pulses at a very slow rhythm, trying to match the rhythm of the brain. In fact, they were less than one hertz, less than one cycle per second in terms of a pulse. 
  于是，他们开始刺激大脑，以非常缓慢的节奏输入这些刺激脉冲，试图与大脑的节奏相匹配。事实上，这些脉冲不到一赫兹，每秒不到一个周期。
  1:46:04
  It's almost as though we're trying to act like a Quiet to a flagging lead vocalist. And as these brainwaves are going up and down, you're trying to sing in time with those deep sleep brainwaves. 
  这几乎就像是我们在努力扮演一个安静的主唱。当这些脑电波忽高忽低时，你就在努力配合这些深睡眠脑电波唱歌。
  1:46:18
  And in doing so, you're trying to boost and amplify the size of those deep sleep brainwaves. Now, to begin with, they just waited until they went into deep sleep and they started to stimulate at that frequency. 
  这样做的目的是提高和放大深度睡眠脑电波的大小。一开始，他们只是等到进入深度睡眠后 才开始用这个频率进行刺激。
  1:46:28
  And I'll come back to why that's important in a second. But sure enough, what they demonstrated, they were able to boost the electrical quality of that deep sleep by about 60%. 
  我稍后再谈这一点的重要性。但可以肯定的是，他们的研究结果表明，他们能够将深度睡眠的电能质量提高约60%。
  1:46:38
  And they were also able to almost double the amount of memory benefit that sleep provided, which is very impressive. That is impressive. 
  他们还能将睡眠带来的记忆益处几乎翻倍，这令人印象深刻。令人印象深刻。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvtv4973rtt9kfm1yx27fnnj))
- They just measured the temperature of someone's feet and they looked at how quickly they fell asleep and when they fell asleep. Sure enough, the warmer your feet, the faster you fell asleep. Why? 
  他们测量了某人脚部的温度，并观察了他们入睡的速度和入睡的时间。果然，脚越热，入睡越快。为什么呢？ ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvtv7znp8w9byhhmf5q9bn01))
- It's called the warm bath effect. And many people will say, look, I love to have a warm bath or a hot shower before bed. And I think when I get out, I'm nice and toasty. And it's because I'm nice and warm that I fall asleep and I stay asleep. 
  这就是所谓的温水浴效应。很多人会说，听着，我喜欢睡前泡个温水澡或洗个热水澡。我想，当我洗完澡后，我就会觉得又暖和又舒服。正是因为温暖舒适，我才能睡着，而且一直睡着。
  1:59:54
  It's the exact opposite. When you get out of the warm bath or the shower, You have once again vasodilated at the surface of your skin, you get out of the bath, you get this huge thermal dump of heat away from the core, what happens? 
  情况恰恰相反。当你从温暖的浴缸或淋浴中出来时，你的皮肤表面血管再次扩张，你从浴缸中出来时，你会从核心部位获得巨大的热量倾泻，会发生什么呢？
  2:00:09
  You fall asleep and you stay asleep more soundly. Now, there are other reasons that that has a benefit. It's relaxing, you decompress, you're staying away from technology, etc. But that is one of the thermal benefits. 
  你会睡得更香，睡得更踏实。这样做还有其他好处。它能让人放松、减压、远离科技等等。但这只是热效应的好处之一。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvtvgq9d0denez7fswekym08))
- They were rotating the bed, not at this sort of around one Hertz, which is what we've done with electrical stimulation or acoustic stimulation. They were doing it at 0.25 Hertz, which is much slower still. 
  他们是在旋转床，而不是以这种大约一赫兹的频率，也就是我们所做的电刺激或声波刺激。他们是在 0.25 赫兹的频率下进行的，这要慢得多。
  2:15:56
  The bed is rocking, you know, once every four seconds. It's a very slow lull. And sure enough, what they found in the first series of studies, they did a nap study, a 90-minute nap study. 
  床在摇晃，每四秒钟摇晃一次。这是一种非常缓慢的平静果然，他们在第一轮研究中发现 他们做了一个小睡研究 90分钟的小睡研究
  2:16:16
  When you did this rocking motion versus when the bed was still, they increased the speed with which people fell asleep. They boosted the amount of deep sleep and they boosted the amount of those sleep spindle oscillations that we described. 
  当你做这种摇摆动作时，与床静止不动时相比，人们入睡的速度加快了。他们提高了深度睡眠的数量，也提高了我们所描述的睡眠主轴振荡的数量。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvtw0msbhdg8g9jrjwtmt7s9))
