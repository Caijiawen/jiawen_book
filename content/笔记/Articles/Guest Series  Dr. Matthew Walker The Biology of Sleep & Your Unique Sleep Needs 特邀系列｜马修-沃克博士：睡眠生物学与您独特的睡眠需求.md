  问：皮质醇与刚睡醒有什么关系？
  A: Cortisol is a hormone that is released by the body in response to stress. It helps to wake us up and prepare us for action. However, too much cortisol can lead to problems such as anxiety and insomnia. When we sleep, our cortisol levels drop. This helps us to relax and fall asleep.
