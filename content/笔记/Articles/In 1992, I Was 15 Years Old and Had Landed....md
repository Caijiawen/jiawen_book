- Summary: In 1992, I was 15 years old and had landed in Japan for my first extended trip abroad. I would be an exchange student at Seikei Gakuen high school for one year.

On the first day of classes, I reported to the faculty lounge in my required navy-blue uniform, looking like a West Point cadet. I nervously awaited my student chaperone, who would be taking me to my “home class,” the group of 40 or so students I’d be spending most of my time with. One of the faculty members noticed me sitting in the corner and approached:

“Ah, Timu-kun!” he said with a wave. Kun is like -san but used to address male inferiors.

“Kore wa . . .”  This is . . . he said as he pointed at a mysterious piece of paper. I could barely manage greetings, so he hailed an English teacher to explain the document. The page, written entirely in characters I couldn’t read, detailed my daily schedule, as it turned out.

The English teacher translated: “Physics, mathematics, world history, kobun—ah . . . traditional Japanese,” and on it went.

Panic set...
