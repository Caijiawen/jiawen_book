## Highlights
- The greatest people in the world can't do it. And the point is that writing is incredibly hard. It just is. It's like running. It's like running. Running is always going to be difficult. Same with weight training, right? 
  世界上最伟大的人都做不到。关键是，写作是一件非常困难的事情。就是这样。就像跑步一样就像跑步。跑步总是很困难的重量训练也一样，对吧？

  They're just difficult professions where you're just going to have to grind, you're going to have to push yourself. No one is ripped like Arnold Schwarzenegger who never goes to the gym and just grunts and gets after it. 
  这些都是艰苦的职业，你必须磨练自己，逼迫自己。没有人能像阿诺德-施瓦辛格那样，从不去健身房，只是闷头苦练。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0apdr914f28k1jkbx9zmszb))
- But that's why Seinfeld says you got a time box. So what does that mean? How do you push through and get yourself to write when you don't want to? And here's what Seinfeld says. He says, commit to a set writing time. 
  所以《宋飞正传》才说你有个时间盒那是什么意思？当你不想写的时候，你该如何坚持下去？宋飞是这么说的他说，承诺一个固定的写作时间。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0apfas7dqjtf37rjmrkxytq))

- I can do that. Okay, an hour is too long? How about 30 minutes? How about 15? You can do 15 minutes, Seinfeld says. You can do 15 minutes. And once again, Seinfeld said to his daughter, 
  我可以做到这一点。好吧，一个小时太长了？30分钟怎么样？15 分钟怎么样？你可以做15分钟，宋飞说。你可以做 15 分钟。宋飞再一次对女儿说：

  he's sort of consoling her as she's working through the arduous struggles that we face as a writer, and he goes, you have to have an end time to your writing session. 
  他在安慰她，因为她正在经历作为一名作家所面临的艰苦奋斗，他说，你的写作必须有一个结束的时间。

  If you're going to sit down at a desk with a problem and do nothing else, you've got to get a reward for that. And the reward is this, the alarm goes off and you're done. You walk up, you walk away, and you go have some cookies and milk. 
  如果你要坐在书桌前处理问题而不做其他事情，你就必须为此获得奖励。奖励就是，闹钟一响，你就完事了。你走起来，走开，然后去吃点饼干和牛奶。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0aptvth5tedr3khry4hn748))
- You don't have to write when you're sitting there. But you can't do anything else. 
  当你坐在那里时，你不必写作。但你不能做别的事

  There's none of this getting distracted on Twitter, none of this checking texts, going to some website that you use to distract yourself, reading the news, checking ESPN, going to your favorite blog. No, no, you got to cut that out. 
  你不能在推特上分心，不能查看短信，不能进入某个你用来分散注意力的网站，不能阅读新闻，不能查看ESPN，不能进入你最喜欢的博客。不，不，你得戒掉这些。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0ateb5qa19ajhtcpms4692g))
- And the best way to write better jokes is to write every day. So Seinfeld tells the young comic to get a big ol' wall calendar that has a whole year on one page. You got this giant calendar. 
  要想写出更好的笑话，最好的办法就是每天都写。所以宋飞告诉这位年轻的喜剧演员 去买一本大挂历 上面一页就写了一整年的内容你有这个巨型挂历

  You just hang it on a prominent wall inside your house, inside your office, and then you get a big ol' fat red marker. And for every single day that you get your writing done, you get to put a big ol' X over that day. 
  你只需把它挂在家里或办公室里显眼的墙上，然后拿一个大大的红色记号笔。每完成一天的写作，你就可以在这一天打上一个大大的 "X"。
  12:35
  And here's what Seinfeld said. After a few days of writing, you'll have a chain. Keep at it and the chain will grow longer every day. 
  宋飞是这么说的写几天之后，你就会有一条链子。坚持下去，链条就会一天天加长。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0atf7vaf13mmfwjn9pn7e0z))
