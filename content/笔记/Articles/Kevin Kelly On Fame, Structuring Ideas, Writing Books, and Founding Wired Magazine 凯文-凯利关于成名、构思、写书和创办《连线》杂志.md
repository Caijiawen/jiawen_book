- Every single sentence that you produce should not have existed anywhere else in the universe before. 
  你的每一句话都不应该在宇宙中的任何地方出现过。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxekyhmjskts4rfhthmn7bm9))
- not the genesis pass where you don't want to have your editor going, but the secondary pass where you begin to evaluate is I question almost every single sentence and with two questions. One is, do I really believe this? 
  我几乎对每一句话都要提出质疑，而且有两个问题。一个是，我真的相信这些吗？
  02:31
  And two, am I just sort of, is this a phrase that would have occurred somewhere else? Like ideally, every single sentence that you produce should not have existed anywhere else in the universe before. 
  其二，我是不是有点，这句话是不是在别的地方也会出现？就像理想情况下，你造出的每一句话都不应该在宇宙中其他地方出现过。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxem2wy39856389n0xvrxwf8))
- But the only recipe that I have ever seen for writing great stuff has been to write a lot of stuff. 
  但是，我所见过的写出好文章的唯一秘诀就是写出大量的文章。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxem3ewhgx75swysk0hg95as))
- That was our thing, amaze me. That's my first principle to the writers. 
  这就是我们的工作，让我大吃一惊。这是我对编剧们的首要原则。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxema8pj75xzkdnk7h2j4n30))
- It's funny because no one's really asked about that but I think that's really crucial. I think I picked up Or I was attracted to Stewart Brand because he's actually the OG of this. 
  有趣的是，没有人问过这个问题，但我认为这一点非常重要。我想我是被斯图尔特-布兰德吸引了，因为他是这方面的鼻祖。
  17:19
  His life is the Forrest Gump of our world because he has been at the edge and the frontier and the forefront of almost most of the cultural movements. 
  他的一生就是我们这个世界的阿甘正传，因为他一直处于几乎大多数文化运动的边缘、前沿和最前沿。
  17:32
  And, you know, like in 1972, he wrote an article for Rolling Stone about computer hackers. 72. It's like, there it was. There was some machines in the, excuse me, basement of Stanford and there were these long hair guys playing Star Wars. 
  1972年，他为《滚石》杂志写了一篇关于电脑黑客的文章。72.就在那里斯坦福大学的地下室里有几台机器 有几个长头发的家伙在玩 "星球大战
  17:57
  It's like he saw it. He saw the, and then he kind of just decided to hang out at that frontier. So, I wrote a book called Out of Control that was published in 94. It was written late 80s and early 90s. 
  他好像看到了他看到了，然后他就决定在那个前沿地带闲逛。所以，我写了一本书，叫《失控》，94年出版。写于80年代末90年代初
  18:11
  And I had a whole chapter on digital encrypted money because I found those guys really interesting talking about crypto basically, but there wasn't blockchain, there was other forms of encryption. 
  我有一整章都是关于数字加密货币的，因为我发现那些人基本上都在谈论加密货币，非常有趣，但当时还没有区块链，只有其他形式的加密。
  18:25
  And that was so much of a scene that when we started Wired, I assigned Steven Levy to kind of follow up and he eventually wrote a whole book. About that. 
  这是个大场面，以至于我们创办《连线》时，我指派史蒂文-李维去跟进，他最终写了一整本书。关于这本书
  18:39
  So, I like, you know, finding, identifying, looking for seen uses and we'll explain what that is. And then trying to hang around and seeing if there's something I don't understand that I want to write about in order to understand it myself. 
  所以，我喜欢，你知道，寻找，识别，寻找被看到的用途，我们会解释那是什么。然后，我还会四处逛逛，看看是否有我不了解的东西，我想写下来，以便自己了解它。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxemx77ytzb2xvzd5mna7krw))
- So a senior is a term that Brian Eno coined. It was his observation that a lot of the great artists of the world, that their genius kind of flowered primarily when they were in a group of others who were They were egging each other on, 
  "前辈 "是布莱恩-伊诺创造的一个词。根据他的观察，世界上很多伟大的艺术家 他们的天才都是在和一群人在一起的时候绽放的 他们互相鼓励，互相帮助
  19:20
  they were urging, they were slightly competing, they were trying to outdo and show off to each other. The audience of their art was in some ways each other, their peers. That structure produced really, 
  他们相互督促，略有竞争，试图超越对方，向对方炫耀。他们艺术的观众在某种程度上是彼此，是他们的同龄人。这种结构产生了真正的、
  19:33
  really great works and that even people who were not or by themselves would not have been as great were amplified by being part of a group and he called that group a seniors. 
  他说，"真正伟大的作品"，"即使不是伟大的人，或者单靠他们自己也不会那么伟大的人，也会因为加入了一个团体而变得更加伟大，他称这个团体为前辈"。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxemyh1kxzkwcgn307syejcg))
- I think where a lot of the seniors is happening right now is YouTube. These little YouTube groups where someone has something they've discovered how to modify, you know, a harbor freight, cheap harbor freight into something really cool. 
  我觉得现在很多前辈都在YouTube上。YouTube上的这些小团体里，有人发现了一些如何改装的方法，你知道，把一个廉价的港货改装成很酷的东西。
  22:08
  And then someone else sees that, that's a great idea. My friend did that. I'm going to modify it a little bit more and I'll make my video and it goes back out. And then two days later, someone else's. 
  然后别人看到了，这是个好主意。我朋友就是这么做的。我打算再修改一下，然后我再拍视频，这样就能发布出去了。然后两天后，别人的也会出现。
  22:17
  And so, you see this, I mean, the really good YouTubers are watching all the other YouTubers in their little seniors. And so, But it's kind of invisible and you know, I can talk forever about YouTube because I think it's way, ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxen4f6q05t647q9yz289738))
- So, one of the pieces of advice in this little book is... Don't aim to be the best, be the only. 
  因此，这本小书中的一条建议是...不求最好，但求唯一。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxep670sdzfjd7jty53ghznd))
- And to have a deadline because what a deadline prevents you from doing is being perfect, so you have to be different. 
  而且要有最后期限，因为最后期限让你无法做到完美，所以你必须与众不同。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxep6esykky6ccvg6qca9h6t))
- Well, there's another piece of advice for young people which is if at all possible, try to work on something or somewhere where there's no name for what it is that you're doing. 
  给年轻人的另一个建议是，如果可能的话，尽量在没有任何名称的地方工作。
  27:03
  Where you might have difficulty explaining to your mother what it is because that is the spot where the breakthroughs happen when there's no name. So, it's like 10 years ago, you're kind of like you're doing podcasting. 
  你可能很难向你的母亲解释它是什么，因为在没有名字的时候，突破就发生在这里。所以，就像十年前，你有点像在做播客。
  27:16
  It's like, well, it's kind of like radio, but it's not quite radio. It's sort of... And so, you're at the good spot. And part of that is about Not aiming for the best, but to be the only, and that is an incredibly high bar.
  27:35
  That takes most of us, including me, most of my life to arrive there, to figure out what that is. There may be some prodigies who are born who very early on have some notion of what it is that they can do better than other people. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxepe27ez35zsezywkh6wrjh))
- I think the center of the culture has moved away from books to moving images to video. That is the center of the culture. My kids are not reading books. Their friends are not reading books. They're watching YouTube. 
  我认为文化的中心已经从书籍转移到活动图像和视频。这才是文化的中心。我的孩子们不看书。他们的朋友也不看书。他们在看 YouTube。
  35:24
  And that is now the center of the culture. So, I wanted to do something that's native to that and they can have like a spinoff book that comes out of it, but it's not, that's not the native thing. 
  现在那里是文化的中心。所以，我想做一些原生态的东西，他们可以从中衍生出衍生书，但这不是，这不是原生态的东西。
  35:40
  The native thing that I wanna be, I wanna be present. In this arena where all the attention is. I have a little media empire where we do newsletters, we do some podcasts for a long time, we do a daily blog for 20 years, you know, 
  我想成为的原生之物，就是 "存在"。在这个万众瞩目的舞台上。我有一个小小的媒体帝国，我们做新闻通讯，我们长期做一些播客，我们做了 20 年的每日博客，你知道的、
  35:58
  I have books and stuff and the social media and YouTube channels and the only place where we see a growing audience is in YouTube. 
  我有书和其他东西，还有社交媒体和 YouTube 频道，而我们看到受众不断增加的唯一地方就是 YouTube。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxeptpyc4v245ym5tsnj4jb7))
- Where you have no agenda for what you're doing other than the pleasure and the thing itself. I did a drawing, piece of painting and posted it every day for a year. There's no, I have no agenda. 
  除了快乐和事情本身，你没有任何目的。我画了一幅画，每天都贴出来，一贴就是一年。我没有任何目的。
  41:09
  There was like, I'm doing it and posting it only because that act of doing it was pleasurable. And this book of 50 years of photography, I was doing it, again, almost like a compulsion. There was no economic possible reason for doing it. 
  我这样做并把它发表出来，只是因为这样做很快乐。而这本 50 年的摄影集，我做它，又几乎是一种强迫。这样做没有任何经济上的理由。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxeqan8ds0pqhcxqk7xcqgv3))
- Exactly. So, this sort of playfulness, generative creativity that I think people should do more of and I would recommend that for the pleasure and not always be thinking about the productivity success part of it. 
  没错。所以，我认为人们应该多做这种游戏性、创造性的事情，我建议大家去享受这种乐趣，而不是总想着要获得成功。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxeqb1vbrxkkwdxwrr325c4z))
- Oh, so I define and that's another bit of advice. I defined, there's a difference between being rich and being wealthy. The rich have a lot of money, the wealthy have time and control their time. 
  哦，所以我下定义，这是另一个建议。我的定义是，富有和富裕是不同的。富人有很多钱，而富人有时间并能控制自己的时间。
  52:31
  I am one of the wealthiest people on the planet because I have total control of my time and every day is different. And so, I work best with deadlines. So, I need a deadline. Give me a deadline. 
  我是这个星球上最富有的人之一，因为我可以完全掌控自己的时间，而且每天都不一样。因此，我最擅长在截止日期前完成工作。所以，我需要一个最后期限。给我一个最后期限。
  52:46
  I can set my own deadlines but I have to have a deadline. And there's a great book called The Writer's Time. And Stewart Brand turned me on to it when he was writing his first book. 
  我可以自己设定最后期限，但我必须有一个最后期限。有一本很棒的书叫《作家的时间》。斯图尔特-布兰德在写他的第一本书时让我读到了这本书。
  52:59
  And the major insight from that was, look, the work of creating anything, but particularly a book, is infinite. It's bottomless. The amount of work, energy, research, writing that could go into your book is unlimited. You can always add more.
  53:25
  So, you can't manage the work, you can only manage your time. So, there was this idea that you say like basically, I'm not gonna write the best book, I'm gonna write the best book I can in a year. Okay? So, you're gonna manage your time. 
  因此，你无法管理作品，只能管理时间。所以，有这样一个想法，你说，基本上，我不会写最好的书，我要写最好的书，我可以在一年。好吗？所以，你要管理好自己的时间。
  53:41
  And so, deadlines do that for me. It's like, yeah, I'm gonna do the best article I can for the deadline. And the deadline is like, you know, it's fantastic because then after the deadline's done, I abandon the book. 
  所以，截稿日期对我来说就是这样。这就像，是的，我要在截稿期限内写出最好的文章。截稿日期就像，你知道，这太棒了 因为截稿日期一过，我就放弃这本书了
  53:55
  I mean, books are abandoned as far as I can tell. And so, yeah, I can set my own deadlines and then, so I'm always looking forward to that moment when the first draft is done and I can then, 
  我的意思是，在我看来，书是被遗弃的。所以，是的，我可以设定自己的最后期限 然后，我总是期待着初稿完成的那一刻，然后我就可以、
  54:10
  you know, work on these blocks of things and try and edit stuff. 
  你知道，在这些东西上下功夫，尝试编辑东西。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxeqmr8pzrberzhmhmqpdabp))
- So, I have a piece of advice that You know, enthusiasm is worth 25 IQ points. And that's a little bit more also about optimism and Positivity. 
  所以，我有一个建议，你知道，热情抵得上 25 点智商。这也是关于乐观和积极的。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxeqntq4bhhrxw86wnc4s1hg))
- Hiring people who have that innate love for whatever it is and not hiring so much around skills and you can teach that. 
  雇用那些对任何事情都有与生俱来的热爱的人，而不是雇用那么多有技能的人，你可以教他们技能。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxeqsmrb1csmj3hg44gq6cyz))
- We were on our way to do all kinds of other things if we didn't have the failed IPO, but the thing was, is we were hiring people to develop the web before, just as the web was being invented. So, there were no web developers. 
  如果没有上市失败，我们还可以做其他各种事情，但问题是，在网络被发明出来之前，我们就在雇人开发网络了。所以，当时没有网络开发人员。
  57:08
  So, we're hiring, so how do you hire? So, we hire for attitude, Aptitude, enthusiasm, and then you train for skills. 
  那么，我们正在招聘，你们是如何招聘的呢？我们的招聘标准是态度、能力、热情，然后再进行技能培训。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxeqt1w2g59m7t1v3zgcjetw))
- And so, I'm now prepared and understanding that when I finish writing the book and there's the last sign off on the final draft of the galley, that I'm now half done. I've done 50% of the book. The other 50% is marketing it. 
  因此，我现在已经做好了准备，并且明白，当我写完这本书，在最终的样书草稿上最后一次签字时，我已经完成了一半。我已经完成了这本书的50%。另外 50%就是营销了。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxeqx36hyh7k14fj7ndmbgev))
- So, books and reading are important, but you really do want to Read widely and differently and a really good trick, by the way, for reading is to read the authors that your favorite authors read. Okay? That's a great way. 
  因此，书籍和阅读很重要，但你真的需要广泛阅读、不同阅读，顺便说一下，阅读的一个非常好的窍门就是阅读你喜欢的作家所阅读的作品。好吗？这是一个很好的方法。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxeqz9vdyr2cyg5933dq1re0))
- so that sharing I came to see as part of that process of learning how to think and write better was what do people respond to, do they get it, where was I successful, where not? And so, for me, it's a way of Of two things, 
  因此，在学习如何更好地思考和写作的过程中，我开始将分享视为一部分，那就是人们的反应是什么，他们是否理解，我在哪些方面成功了，哪些方面失败了？因此，对我来说，这是做两件事的一种方式、
  1:17:11
  accessing and helping me think and then two, 
  访问并帮助我思考，然后是两个、
  1:17:14
  to accomplish my mission because I write about technology and stuff is to increase the number of options and opportunities in the world so that everybody would have a chance to express their genius. 
  因为我写的是技术之类的东西，所以我的使命就是增加世界上的选择和机会，让每个人都有机会展现自己的才华。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxer1dwa0dqw46j1hbpaf5ps))
