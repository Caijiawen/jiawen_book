## Highlights
- Metonymy is where a shorthand term stands in for a literal term. It's very technical, but I don't mind technical. So what actually they're saying there, what they should say is 1,000 songs in your media player. That's what it literally is. 
  转喻是用速记术语代替字面术语的地方。这是非常技术性的，但我不介意技术性。所以他们实际上所说的是，他们应该说的是你的媒体播放器中有 1,000 首歌曲。这就是它的字面意思。

  But they've substituted the literal word media player For a standing word, a visual word, pocket. That sentence doesn't literally make sense. 
  但他们用字面意思“媒体播放器”代替了一个站立词、一个视觉词“口袋”。这句话从字面上看没有任何意义。

  You haven't literally got a thousand songs in your pocket, you've got a thousand songs in your media player, but you'd rather say pocket because it's more visual, it's more surprising, it's more punchy.
