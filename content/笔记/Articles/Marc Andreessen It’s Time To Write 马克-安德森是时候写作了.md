- Um, and so all of my bottled up energy came What is it? Hemingway said writing is the process of opening a vein and letting the blood spread out of the page. 
  嗯，于是我所有积蓄的能量都涌了出来 什么是能量？海明威说过，写作就是打开血管，让血液从书页中流淌出来的过程。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxetz92eap5kvzekd6afcdkr))
- Like I read the, was it Umberto Eco book at one point about how to write a thesis and he's got the card catalog system. 
  就像我读过的那本翁贝托-艾柯（Umberto Eco）的书，书中提到了如何撰写论文，他有一套卡片目录系统。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxevwh80tdtf61cest1g607d))
- So I'm trying to go even faster. So that first phase, I'm trying to go even faster. I'm trying to get all the points out and I don't want to slow down the process of getting all the points out by trying to turn them all into prose. 
  所以我想再快一点。所以在第一阶段，我想更快一些。我想把所有要点都写出来，我不想把所有要点都变成散文，从而减慢写要点的速度。
  05:20
  So it's not like a detailed outline like a novelist would have or something like that, but it's like basically bullet points. I sort of think in terms of bullet points. 
  因此，它不像小说家会有的详细大纲或类似的东西，但基本上是要点。我的思维方式就是要点式的。
  05:28
  And so it's basically just if I can list the 15 or 20 key points, then I can just get them all out. And like I said, for me to be doing this at this point, 
  所以，基本上只要我能列出 15 或 20 个要点，就能把它们都说出来。就像我说的，对于我来说，在这个时候做这件事、
  05:37
  I've been thinking about the topic long enough where I have a bunch of stuff that I know that I want to say. And so I try to put all down and then I try to have that be in some sort of sensible order. 
  我思考这个话题的时间已经够长了，我知道自己有一大堆话想说。于是，我试着把所有的东西都写下来，然后按照某种合理的顺序排列。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxfw5d8bz36j1e4et2f9c3xq))
- Like an hour with somebody who's a specialist in topic X, you're just going to learn a lot. That's not obvious. So that's part of it. And then the reading side, I'm just basically every day, I've always been like this. 
  比如说，和某个在 X 主题方面很专业的人在一起一个小时，你就会学到很多东西。这一点并不明显。这就是其中的一部分。在阅读方面，我基本上每天都阅读，我一直都是这样。
  07:51
  I'm reading basically every spare minute that I have. Well, sort of everything. And so actually, interestingly, 
  我基本上一有空就看书。嗯，算是什么都看。有趣的是
  07:58
  the AirPods are probably the single biggest technological leap in my life since I was probably a little kid that like actually really mattered because they're the unlock for me for audio books and podcasts and interviews and all these things. 
  AirPods 可能是我人生中最大的一次技术飞跃，从我还是个小孩子的时候起，它就像一个真正重要的东西，因为它是我阅读有声读物、播客和访谈以及所有这些东西的解锁工具。
  08:09
  And so I'm doing audio content probably two to three hours a day. And it's, you know, getting up in the morning, going to bed at night, all the drive time, like all that stuff. And so nothing else is going on. 
  所以我每天大概要做两到三个小时的音频内容。而且，你知道，早上起床，晚上睡觉，所有的开车时间，就像所有这些事情一样。就这样，没有其他事情了。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxfw7sp5rf8t8ygy3kmy5bq2))
- Rochefoucauld and all these people would write it as aphorisms. And then at some point that became like a self, there was like a self, it was like a, you know, poor Richard's almanac kind of thing. 
  罗什福柯和所有这些人都会把它写成警句。到了后来，这就成了一种自我，有一种自我，就像可怜的理查德年鉴那种东西。
  20:59
  And at some point they got corny and people like stopped using aphorisms, you know, like witty little asides and stuff like that. And it just kind of went out of fashion. And then tweets. And Twitter brought back the aphorism. 
  到了后来，人们就不再用警句了 比如诙谐的小插曲什么的它就这样过时了然后推特推特又把警句带回来了
  21:10
  Twitter's aphorism is in service. But it's like there is historical continuity there. And it's actually funny because if you could take Nietzsche from 120 years ago and put him on Twitter, he'd be like the best tweeter of all time. 
  推特的箴言在发挥作用。但这就像是历史的连续性。这其实很有趣，因为如果你能把120年前的尼采搬到推特上，他就会成为有史以来最好的推手。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxfx66dgtjdf1vxnvxrv5fp0))
- There's a lot of people giving advice to startups that maybe have not actually been through all the things that they're talking about. For better or for worse, I've been through it all, and I've made all the mistakes, 
  有很多人在给初创企业提建议时，也许并没有真正经历过他们所说的那些事情。无论好坏，我都经历过，犯过所有的错误、
  24:03
  and I've seen it all, and I've lived with the consequences of all the decisions that you make at a startup, and so I figured I should just actually start to write some of this stuff down. 
  我见过这一切，也经历过初创公司所有决策的后果，所以我想我应该开始把这些东西写下来。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxfy3p01gsfz8yjgd0sge14f))
- l-a-t-e-r-a-l, lateral, in that, and I actually tell you who they are, it's actually him, it's Balaji Srinivasan, and it's Peter Thiel. And what those, and those, they're very different, you know, 
  我告诉你他们是谁，其实就是他，巴拉吉-斯里尼瓦桑，还有彼得-蒂尔。这两个人是完全不同的、
  24:45
  they're very different views and very different kind of life trajectories, but what they all have in common is when they're presented with a situation, they never think about it the way everybody else does, like they just, they don't. 
  他们的观点迥异，人生轨迹也大相径庭，但他们的共同点是，当他们遇到某种情况时，他们从来不会像其他人那样去思考，就像他们只是，他们不会。
  24:55
  And so as a consequence, like I'll spend as much time with the three of those as I possibly can. Because what I find, like I'm an okay lateral thinker, but they're much better than I am. And I think it's two things. 
  因此，我会花尽可能多的时间和他们三个在一起。因为我发现，我的横向思维还不错，但他们比我强多了。我觉得有两点
  25:07
  One is they're just really smart and they know a lot about a lot of things. And so they're able to sort of apply a lot, able to kind of cross different kinds of knowledge together. 
  一是他们真的很聪明，知道很多事情。因此，他们能够应用很多东西，能够把不同种类的知识交叉在一起。
  25:17
  But the other is they all have, it's not even a habit, it's just how they are, they do this reflexively. And so what I find is if I spend time with them, I start to also do it reflexively. 
  但另一种情况是，他们都有，这甚至不是一种习惯，只是他们就是这样，他们会条件反射地这样做。所以我发现，如果我花时间和他们在一起，我也会条件反射地这样做。
  25:29
  Cause I just, I always think like, okay, well, you know, if I were a true lateral thinker the way they are, like, how would I think about this? Um, and so, you know, being with them over the years has kind of trained me of like, 
  因为我总是在想，好吧，你知道，如果我是一个真正的横向思维者，就像他们那样，我会怎么想呢？嗯，所以，你知道，这些年和他们在一起，让我学会了：
  25:39
  okay, when somebody says X, like never just take it on face value, always be like, you know, okay, there's another way of looking at this, you know, or if somebody proposes a certain plan of action, right. 
  好吧，当有人说 X 的时候，千万不要只看表面价值，一定要像，你知道，好吧，还有另一种方式来看待这个问题，你知道，或者如果有人提出某种行动计划，对吧。
  25:48
  Or somebody has an assessment of how the world works, like let's come at it from multiple angles and try to think about that. 
  或者有人对世界是如何运作的有一个评估，比如让我们从多个角度来思考这个问 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxfy53emanbyy5yvq7gq4tvx))
- And so there are various examples. A TV version of a Romana Clef would be the, if you've seen the show, Ray Donovan, it was a show about a Hollywood fixer, 
  这样的例子不胜枚举。如果你看过《雷-多诺万》（Ray Donovan）这部剧，它是一部关于好莱坞掮客的电视剧、

  a guy who goes around and like fixes problems for studios with like all these everything screwed up Hollywood. 
  他四处奔波，为好莱坞的电影公司解决各种问题。
  37:25
  And it's a fictional show, but the legend has it is that every single situation he fixes in the show is something that actually happened in Hollywood at some point. 
  虽然这是一个虚构的节目，但传说中他在节目中解决的每一个问题都是好莱坞真实发生过的。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxfyachm66tqcpzjtbjv1g79))
- which is like the person who writes down the thing has tremendous power. Independent of their actual formal role in an organization or in the world, there are so few people who will just like write down the thing. 
  这就好比写下这件事的人拥有巨大的权力。无论他们在一个组织或世界中实际扮演的正式角色如何，很少有人会像写下这件事那样。
  40:38
  And so I see, we see this at companies all the time, which is, you know, one of the ways you find like the up and comers at a tech company, it's just like, okay, who wrote down the plan? And that doesn't mean they came up with everything. 
  所以我看到，我们在公司里经常看到这种情况，你知道，你发现科技公司的新秀的方法之一就是，好吧，是谁写下了计划？这并不意味着他们想出了一切。
  40:47
  And that doesn't mean that they had all the ideas, but like, they're actually able to organize their thoughts and actually have the energy and the motivation, 
  这并不意味着他们有所有的想法，而是说，他们确实能够组织自己的思想，确实有精力和动力、
  40:53
  the skill to be able to communicate in a written form like that, that actually stands out. 
  能以这样的书面形式进行交流的技能，实际上是非常突出的。
  40:57
  And you would think that that was, I would always kind of assume everybody would know that, but like the number of people who will actually write anything down. You know, with that requisite level of like comprehensiveness and quality. 
  你会认为，这是， 我总是那种假设 每个人都会知道， 但喜欢的人的数量 谁愿意真正 写下来的东西。你知道，有必要的水平 像全面性和质量。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxfye4vsed0r08t9msv91wqa))

- I actually think you can, there are a fair number of people now who I follow on Twitter where I realize that they are geniuses based on a single tweet. 
  事实上，我认为你可以，现在我在推特上关注的人中，有相当一部分人让我仅凭一条推特就意识到他们是天才。

  It's just like they made some point and I was just like, wow, like there's something special going on there. Right. 
  就好像他们提出了一些观点，我就觉得，哇，好像有什么特别的东西在那里。没错
