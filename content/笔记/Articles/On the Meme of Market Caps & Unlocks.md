- Summary: Some thoughts on market caps, valuations, tokenomics and unlocks. I have noticed that even many sophisticated crypto twitter participants still don’t know how to use these values to inform their investments or trades. Will write some thoughts and just press publish when I get bored.

## Highlights
- Well, locked tokens can actually have an active market of their own. Professional and sophisticated investors trade locked coins using trust & legal enforcement as their guarantees. Basically, they buy or sell locked coins with a discount to the market price and sign contractual obligations with their counterparty to send the coins as they become unlocked. Sometimes these locked coins even have their lock extended during this OTC sale (particularly if the team is the seller). 
  那么，被锁定的代币实际上可以有一个自己的活跃市场。专业和成熟的投资者使用信任和法律执行作为他们的保证来交易锁定的硬币。基本上，他们以市场价格的折扣购买或出售锁定的硬币，并与他们的对手方签署合同义务，在硬币解锁时发送。有时，这些锁定的硬币甚至在这种场外交易的销售过程中延长其锁定期（特别是如果团队是卖方）。
  Imagine some initial seed investors sold their locked position for a 10x profit to another VC, and this VC in turn sold their position for a 5x. The tokens that are now coming “unlocked” have a cost basis not too far away from the current market price, some market participant’s expectations were that the holders were sitting at a 100x profit. Since some investors expect the unlock event to be bearish, but it is actually neutral, this removal of a bearish catalyst can result in a net bullish event. 
  想象一下，一些最初的种子投资者以10倍的利润将他们的锁定头寸卖给了另一家风险投资公司，而这家风险投资公司又以5倍的价格卖出了他们的头寸。现在即将 "解锁 "的代币的成本基础与目前的市场价格相差不大，一些市场参与者的预期是持有人坐拥100倍的利润。由于一些投资者预期解锁事件是看跌的，但实际上是中性的，这种看跌催化剂的消除会导致净看涨事件。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h254wpwewcazpt43t96e5f8k))
