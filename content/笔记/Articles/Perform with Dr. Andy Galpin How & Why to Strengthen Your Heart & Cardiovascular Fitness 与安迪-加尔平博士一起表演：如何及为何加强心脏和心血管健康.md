- Category: #articles
- Summary: The text discusses the importance of understanding and improving cardiovascular health for both performance and overall health. It emphasizes the significance of factors like heart rate, cardiac output, and VO2 max in assessing and enhancing cardiovascular fitness. The heart's unique muscle fibers and structure are highlighted, showing the need for specialized training approaches for optimal heart function.

## Highlights
- And in that initial study, he was really the first one that said, hey, when we look at VO2 max and we compare that to say smoking or cardiovascular disease, it's as strong if not a stronger predictor of how long you're going to live, 
  在最初的研究中，他是第一个说，嘿，当我们观察最大氧饱和度，并将其与吸烟或心血管疾病进行比较时，它是预测你能活多久的有力指标，甚至更有力、

  than any of these other metrics. 
  而不是其他任何指标。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j06j285swnt6nazx9qwhx2f8))
- To be better at playing golf or basketball or pickleball or riding mountain bikes, I don't really care. Whether you wanna have more energy, more recovery, better sleep throughout the day. 
  为了更好地打高尔夫球、篮球、皮球或骑山地自行车，我真的不在乎。无论你是想精力更充沛、恢复能力更强，还是想整天睡得更好。
  15:43
  Something like a VO2 Max is gonna be intricately involved in all of those things. 
  像最大氧饱和度这样的指标会与所有这些因素密切相关。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j06j36gmc8cpbce3espzpxh2))
- The cardiovascular fitness is inversely associated with long-term mortality and not observed to be an upper limit. What that also means is There doesn't seem to be any reduction in the benefit by continuing to increase your VO2 max. 
  心血管健康与长期死亡率成反比，而且没有观察到心血管健康的上限。这也意味着，继续提高最大容氧量似乎并不会减少益处。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j06j96yt3z09geat8k44cjh9))
- typically what you'll see in response to exercise or healthy lifestyle behavioral changes, the enlargement in your heart you'll see will be primarily in the left ventricle. 
  一般来说，运动或健康生活方式的改变会导致心脏增大，而心脏增大主要发生在左心室。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j085kv1hmn2sdc6syh5ejmvb))
- and your heart rate at seven miles per hour was 150 beats per minute, and now a couple of months later, your heart rate at the exact same speed is now 115 beats per minute. 
  你的心率在每小时 7 英里时是每分钟 150 次，而几个月后，你的心率在完全相同的速度下现在是每分钟 115 次。
  1:20:53
  That would represent a significant improvement in cardiovascular fitness, stroke volume would be much higher, and because of that, that allows your heart rate to come down. Resting heart rate is a similar story. 
  这将代表心血管健康状况有了明显改善，脑卒中量将大大增加，正因为如此，你的心率才会下降。静息心率也是类似的情况。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j08x8kgb2qvtwj4ekb2h70bz))
- You wanna be something probably in that lower intensity, 60 to 80 ish percent of your heart rate. I don't really care where your millimolars are.
  1:48:53
  In any of those low intensities, you're gonna be challenging the ability to bring in and utilize oxygen over a long period of time. Look at any amount of research on that. 
  在任何一种低强度运动中，你都要挑战长时间吸入和利用氧气的能力。看看这方面的任何研究。
  1:49:03
  It is very clear, steady state, lower intensity exercise, especially over time, six months to a year. 
  很明显，稳定状态、较低强度的运动，尤其是随着时间的推移，六个月到一年的时间。
  1:49:10
  It's generally going to improve VO2 max probably upwards of 5 to 10% depending on the person, the training history and other context like that. 
  一般来说，它能提高最大 VO2 大概 5 到 10%，具体取决于个人、训练历史和其他类似情况。
  1:49:18
  So it's very, very effective and something I have absolutely incorporated more and more into both my life personally as well as my coaching practice. So really important to do that stuff. 
  因此，它非常非常有效，而且我已经将它越来越多地融入到我个人的生活以及我的教练实践中。所以，做这些事情真的很重要。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j08xs171k6g5wteckszw1ecx))
