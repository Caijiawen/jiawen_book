## Highlights
- I get to write about you know Einstein or Steve Jobs or Leonardo da Vinci who as you know was totally torn by demons and had different difficult childhood situations not even legitimized by his father. 
  我可以写爱因斯坦、史蒂夫-乔布斯或达芬奇的故事，你们知道，达芬奇完全是被恶魔折磨出来的，他的童年经历了各种困难，甚至没有得到他父亲的认可。

  So sometimes those of us who are lucky enough to have really gentle sweet childhood. We grow up with fewer demons, but we grow up with fewer drives and we end up maybe being Boswell and not being Dr. Johnson. 
  所以有时我们这些幸运的人 会有一个非常温柔甜蜜的童年我们在成长的过程中会遇到更少的恶魔，但我们在成长的过程中也会遇到更少的驱动力，我们最终也许会成为博斯韦尔，而不是约翰逊博士。

  We end up being the observer, not being the doer. And so I always respect those who are in the arena. I don't, you know. 
  我们最终会成为旁观者，而不是行动者。所以我一直很尊重那些在舞台上的人。我不会，你知道的。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv67y0my5jbn2hvs51xfg91k))
- And every one of my books is about people who were totally innovative, who weren't just smart because none of us are going to be able to match Einstein and mental processing power. 
  我的每一本书都是关于那些具有创新精神的人，他们不仅仅是聪明，因为我们中没有人能够在思维处理能力上与爱因斯坦相提并论。

  But we can be as curious as he was and creative and think out of the box the way he did or Steve Jobs put it, think different. And so I hope with my books, I'm saying, This isn't a how-to guide, but this is somebody you can walk alongside. 
  但是，我们可以像他那样充满好奇心和创造力，像他那样打破常规思维，或者像史蒂夫-乔布斯所说的那样，与众不同。因此，我希望通过我的书，我在说，这不是一本如何做的指南，但这是一个你可以并肩而行的人。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv67mass1zfjkgdqvetm8dxa))
