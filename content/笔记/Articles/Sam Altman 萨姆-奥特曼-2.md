- Summary: Sam Altman reflects on the changing landscape of free speech and innovation, noting that it has become increasingly challenging to discuss controversial ideas in San Francisco compared to Beijing. He emphasizes the importance of allowing a wide range of ideas, including unpopular and potentially disruptive ones, to foster true innovation. Altman warns against the dangers of stifling speech and the impact it can have on societal progress and the development of groundbreaking ideas. He suggests that a culture that encourages diverse viewpoints, even if uncomfortable, is crucial for advancing knowledge and innovation.

## Highlights
- The most counterintuitive secret about startups is that it’s often easier to succeed with a hard startup than an easy one.  A hard startup requires a lot more money, time, coordination, or technological development than most startups. A good hard startup is one that will be valuable if it works (not all hard problems are worth solving!). 
  初创企业最违反直觉的秘密是，与简单的初创企业相比，困难的初创企业往往更容易成功。 与大多数初创企业相比，困难初创企业需要更多的资金、时间、协调或技术开发。一个好的 "难 "创业公司，如果它能成功，就会很有价值（并不是所有的 "难 "问题都值得解决！）。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr45y4x39bqnq3tn1jrbw0xs))
- Easy startups are easy to start but hard to make successful.  The most precious commodity in the startup ecosystem right now is talented people, and for the most part talented people want to work on something they find meaningful. 
  创业容易，成功难。 目前，初创企业生态系统中最珍贵的商品就是人才，而大多数人才都希望从事他们认为有意义的工作。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr45xpn34q7x1vn1j2e4qrns))
- A startup eventually has to get a lot of people to join its quest.  It’s usually reasonably easy to get the first five or ten people to join—you can offer large equity grants and areas of responsibility.  But eventually, what you have to recruit with are the mission of the company, the likelihood of massive success, and the quality of the people there. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr4b8n7rq7wvek195cy55mhn))
- Few recruiting messages are as powerful (when true) as “the world needs this, it won’t happen any time soon if we don’t do it, and we are much less likely to succeed if you don’t join.” 
  很少有招募信息能像 "世界需要这个，如果我们不这样做，它就不会很快实现，如果你不加入，我们成功的可能性就会大大降低 "这样有力（如果真实的话）。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr4b9a0bs47f1zxkwbvbpqc9))
- An easy startup is a headwind; a hard startup is a tailwind.  If people care about your success because you seem committed to doing something significant, it’s a background force helping you with hiring, advice, partnerships, fundraising, etc. 
  容易创业是逆风，艰难创业是顺风。 如果人们关心你的成功，因为你似乎致力于做一些有意义的事情，那么这将成为一股背景力量，在招聘、建议、合作、筹款等方面帮助你。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr45yyf7sy3rxn82aqpxm8w6))
- Part of the magic of Silicon Valley is that people default to taking you seriously if you’re willing to be serious—they’ve learned it’s a very expensive mistake, in aggregate, not to.  If you want to start a company working on a better way to build homes, gene editing, artificial general intelligence, a new education system, or carbon sequestration, you may actually be able to get it funded, even if you don’t have a degree or much experience.  
  硅谷的魅力之一在于，如果你愿意认真对待，人们就会默认你是认真的--他们已经意识到，不认真对待是一个代价高昂的错误。 如果你想创办一家公司，研究建造房屋的更好方法、基因编辑、人工通用智能、新的教育系统或碳封存，即使你没有学位或经验，也有可能获得资助。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr460fdk4bqmexyb6hry1fx2))
- Let yourself become more ambitious—figure out the most interesting version of where what you’re working on could go.  Then talk about that big vision and work relentlessly towards it, but always have a reasonable next step. You don’t want step one to be incorporating the company and step two to be going to Mars. 
  让自己变得更有雄心壮志--找出你正在做的事情最有趣的发展方向。 然后谈论这个远大理想，并为之不懈努力，但一定要有一个合理的下一步。你不会希望第一步是成立公司，第二步是去火星。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr460r6bq6ye9dwcpcs3ad14))
- Be willing to make a very long-term commitment to what you’re doing.  Most people aren’t, which is part of the reason they pick “easy” startups.  In a world of compounding advantages where most people are operating on a 3 year timeframe and you’re operating on a 10 year timeframe, you’ll have a very large edge. 
  愿意对你正在做的事情做出长期承诺。 大多数人不愿意，这也是他们选择 "容易 "的初创企业的部分原因。 在一个复利优势的世界里，大多数人都是以 3 年为时间框架，而你是以 10 年为时间框架，你将拥有非常大的优势。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr460ymwceqsve60atdzhnge))
- Putting a lot of energy into networking actually works, as long as you aren’t just trying to touch base when people can find some time away from their crazy calendars to grab coffee.  If you actually figure out how to help other investors you respect, and to really help good founders, then good investment opportunities will come your way. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr469ez0cvp6bq2evf7cg44n))
- If you’re starting out as a full-time investor, make it your full-time job to figure out how to help people that will become your future investment-sourcing network.  Instead of just asking your contacts to tell you about investment opportunities, ask them if you can spend a day per week helping their best company. In general, early-stage investors can help a lot with closing candidates, future fundraising, customer introductions, and generic advice. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr46f6dm1jdmrvq7x0v2e0rg))
- A brand is the other way to get access.  There are a lot of ways to build one, but by the same principle of working hard, a good example is to write long-form content (hard, few people do a good job at it) instead of tweeting (easy, everyone does a pretty good job at it).  
  品牌是获得访问权的另一种方式。 建立品牌的方法有很多，但根据同样的努力原则，一个很好的例子是撰写长篇内容（很难，很少有人做得好），而不是发推文（很容易，每个人都做得很好）。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr46abvd5404f3qc5dzr7yx2))
- It’s easiest if you get to meet people in person, several times.  If you meet someone three times in three months, and notice detectable improvement each time, pay attention to that.  The rate of improvement is often more important than the current absolute ability (in particular, younger founders can sometimes improve extremely quickly). 
  最简单的办法就是亲自去见人，而且要见几次。 如果你在三个月内与某人见了三次面，并且每次都能发现明显的进步，那就要注意了。 进步的速度往往比当前的绝对能力更重要（尤其是年轻的创始人有时会进步得非常快）。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr46g0jngtzz5kz3ba62e30v))
- I look for founders who are scrappy and formidable at the same time (a rarer combination than it sounds); mission-oriented, obsessed with their companies, relentless, and determined; extremely smart (necessary but certainly not sufficient); decisive, fast-moving, and willful; courageous, high-conviction, and willing to be misunderstood; strong communicators and infectious evangelists; and capable of becoming tough and ambitious.  
  我所寻找的创始人要同时具备以下特质：骁勇善战、威武不屈（这种组合比听起来更罕见）；以使命为导向、对公司痴迷、不懈追求、意志坚定；极其聪明（这是必要条件，但肯定不是充分条件）；果断、行动迅速、意志坚定；勇敢、信念坚定、愿意被误解；具有很强的沟通能力和感染力；能够变得坚韧不拔、雄心勃勃。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr46jt7rdg21fbq3mhay68yv))
- Being a fast mover is a big thing; a somewhat trivial example is that I have almost never made money investing in founders who do not respond quickly to important emails. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr46kdxcyr2exhy4s0qpf5yh))
- 快速行动是一件大事；一个有点微不足道的例子是，我投资的创始人如果不能快速回复重要邮件，我几乎从未赚过钱。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr479aefknrwt7kps1ywjmz4))
- Startups do particularly well in industries with rapid technological change, because their fundamental advantages over large competitors are speed and focus. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr47mx2jpb7vrstbzp5b551p))
- Like the founder, and like a company, what you should care about is the growth rate and eventual size of a market (I don’t know why most investors are so obsessed with the current size of a market instead of how big they think it will be in ten years, but it’s an opportunity for you). 
  就像创始人和公司一样，你应该关心的是市场的增长率和最终规模（我不知道为什么大多数投资者都如此痴迷于市场目前的规模，而不是他们认为十年后市场会有多大，但这对你来说是一个机会）。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr47a8rd2v79m58tvab8q1wb))
- For a real trend, even if there aren’t many users, they use the new platform a lot and love it. For example, although the iPhone was derided for not having many users in its first year or two, most people who had an iPhone raved about it in a way that they never did about previous smartphones. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr47g8rbbj4sbndh6mrqm7rh))
- The spectral signatures of the best companies I’ve invested in are remarkably similar.  They usually have most of the following characteristics: compelling founders, a mission that attracts talented people into the startup’s orbit, a product so good that people spontaneously tell their friends about it, a rapidly growing market, a network effect and low marginal costs, the ability to grow fast, and a product that is either fundamentally new or 10x better than existing options. 
  我投资过的最佳公司的光谱特征非常相似。 它们通常具有以下大部分特征：令人信服的创始人、吸引优秀人才进入初创公司轨道的使命、好到人们会自发向朋友介绍的产品、快速增长的市场、网络效应和低边际成本、快速增长的能力，以及从根本上创新或比现有产品好 10 倍的产品。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr47hh9ehkkz9sra80d7gwxc))
- You should try to limit yourself to opportunities that could be $10 billion companies if they work (which means they have, at least, a fast-growing market and some sort of pricing power).  The power law is that powerful. This is easy to say and hard to do, and I’ve been guilty of violating the principle many times. But the data are clear—the failures don’t matter much, the small successes don’t matter much, and the giant returns are where everything happens. 
  你应该尽量把自己限制在那些一旦成功就能成为百亿美元公司的机会上（这意味着它们至少有一个快速增长的市场和某种定价能力）。 幂律就是这么强大。这句话说起来容易做起来难，我也曾多次违反这一原则。但数据很清楚--失败并不重要，小的成功也不重要，而巨大的回报才是一切发生的源泉。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr480xb11xtgjfwrghj5dx6v))
- The central learning of my career so far has been that you can and should scale up things that are working.  The power of scale, and the emergent behavior that sometimes comes from it, is tremendous. I think about the potential energy of future scale for every investment I make.  Most people seem terrible at this, so it’s another bug you can exploit.   
  迄今为止，我职业生涯的核心经验是，你可以而且应该扩大正在发挥作用的事物的规模。 规模的力量以及有时由此产生的新兴行为是巨大的。我每做一笔投资，都会考虑未来规模的潜在能量。 大多数人在这方面似乎都很糟糕，所以这是你可以利用的另一个漏洞。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr4ay0xbr0tq0abykjpw7w61))
- Traditional sales tactics works pretty well here.  Spend a lot of time with the founder, explain what you’re willing to do to help them, ask founders you’ve worked with in the past to call them, etc.  
  传统的销售策略在这里非常奏效。 花大量时间与创始人沟通，解释你愿意为他们提供哪些帮助，请过去合作过的创始人给他们打电话，等等。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr46nd2f84331pvhthtpk3ed))
- The best way to have a poor close rate is to not treat founders like peers.  If you’re picking well, you should be investing in founders that you think of as your peers at least.  Founders have a sixth sense for who is going to treat them like a peer and who is going to treat them like a boss.  And if they’re good, they know you’re failing an intelligence test if you act like their boss. 
  关闭率低的最好办法就是不把创始人当做同行。 如果你选得好，你至少应该投资那些你认为是同行的创始人。 创始人有第六感，知道谁会把他们当同行，谁会把他们当老板。 如果他们很优秀，他们就会知道，如果你表现得像他们的老板，你就没有通过智力测验。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr4av4p3afctzq11gxbzptjm))
- The most important way to help founders is to get them to be more ambitious—to think bigger and to have more self-belief.  Help them set ambitious but achievable goals. Momentum is important and self-reinforcing—most people set goals that they expect to be just out of reach, which is usually demotivating.  It’s better to continuously set goals that you can just barely hit. 
  帮助创始人的最重要方法是让他们更有雄心壮志--想得更远，更有自信。 帮助他们制定雄心勃勃但可以实现的目标。大多数人设定的目标都是遥不可及的，这通常会打击他们的积极性。 最好的办法是不断设定勉强可以实现的目标。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr4atxhndj5zcmj5zn80g3d8))
- Finally, I’ve found that most of the time when founders call asking for vague help, what they are really asking for is emotional support from a friend.  Invite them over to your house, make them tea or pour them a drink, and start listening to their struggles. 
  最后，我发现当创始人打电话来寻求模糊的帮助时，他们真正需要的是朋友的情感支持。 邀请他们来家里做客，给他们泡茶或倒酒，开始倾听他们的挣扎。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr4as5fb9kbdt01rp507948k))
- I’ve observed thousands of founders and thought a lot about what it takes to make a huge amount of money or to create something important. Usually, people start off wanting the former and end up wanting the latter. 
  我观察过成千上万的创始人，也思考过很多关于赚大钱或创造重要事物的问题。通常，人们一开始想要的是前者，而最终想要的却是后者。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr4a2wz17drqjr10p2r87r43))
- You also want to be an exponential curve yourself—you should aim for your life to follow an ever-increasing up-and-to-the-right trajectory. It’s important to move towards a career that has a compounding effect—most careers progress fairly linearly. 
  你也希望自己成为一条指数曲线--你的人生目标应该是沿着不断向上、向右的轨迹发展。重要的是要朝着具有复合效应的职业发展--大多数职业的发展都是线性的。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr4a845v82d91st0qqefzvwf))
- As your career progresses, each unit of work you do should generate more and more results. There are many ways to get this leverage, such as capital, technology, brand, network effects, and managing people. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr48j8sekygebpbzzgqngx56))
- It’s useful to focus on adding another zero to whatever you define as your success metric—money, status, impact on the world, or whatever. I am willing to take as much time as needed between projects to find my next thing. But I always want it to be a project that, if successful, will make the rest of my career look like a footnote. 
  无论你定义的成功指标是什么--金钱、地位、对世界的影响，或者其他什么，专注于在这些指标上再添一个零是非常有用的。我愿意在各个项目之间花尽可能多的时间去寻找下一个目标。但我总是希望下一个项目如果成功，会让我职业生涯的其他部分看起来像个注脚。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr48m6nzm8rq01y95c3b7d07))
- I think the biggest competitive advantage in business—either for a company or for an individual’s career—is long-term thinking with a broad view of how different systems in the world are going to come together. One of the notable aspects of compound growth is that the furthest out years are the most important. In a world where almost no one takes a truly long-term view, the market richly rewards those who do. 
  我认为，无论是对公司还是对个人职业生涯而言，商业中最大的竞争优势是具有长远眼光的思维方式，以及对世界上不同系统如何结合在一起的广阔视野。复合增长的一个显著特点是，最远的几年才是最重要的几年。在这个几乎没有人真正从长远角度考虑问题的世界里，市场会给那些真正从长远角度考虑问题的人以丰厚的回报。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr48mh9hc4yzr2bdkae2tmz6))
- Self-belief is immensely powerful. The most successful people I know believe in themselves almost to the point of delusion. 
  自信的力量是无穷的。我认识的最成功的人都相信自己，几乎到了妄想的地步。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr48myxfv6wrmztb30rwvswh))
- I remember when Elon Musk took me on a tour of the SpaceX factory many years ago. He talked in detail about manufacturing every part of the rocket, but the thing that sticks in memory was the look of absolute certainty on his face when he talked about sending large rockets to Mars. I left thinking “huh, so that’s the benchmark for what conviction looks like.” 
  我还记得多年前埃隆-马斯克带我参观 SpaceX 工厂的情景。他详细讲述了火箭每个部件的制造过程，但让我记忆犹新的是，当他谈到将大型火箭送上火星时，脸上流露出绝对肯定的神情。我离开时想："呵呵，原来这就是信念的基准啊！" ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr48ncem4jsfa6q76f435xk9))
- Getting good at sales is like improving at any other skill—anyone can get better at it with deliberate practice. But for some reason, perhaps because it feels distasteful, many people treat it as something unlearnable. 
  掌握销售技巧就像提高其他技能一样--任何人都可以通过刻意练习变得更好。但出于某种原因，也许是因为感觉不爽，很多人都把它当作学不会的东西。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr48r6dbpjgh8jacpvpp8j5d))
- My other big sales tip is to show up in person whenever it’s important. When I was first starting out, I was always willing to get on a plane. It was frequently unnecessary, but three times it led to career-making turning points for me that otherwise would have gone the other way. 
  我的另一大销售秘诀是，无论何时，只要有重要的事情，就一定要亲自露面。在我刚出道的时候，我总是愿意坐飞机去。这种做法经常是不必要的，但有三次却为我带来了职业生涯的转折点，否则我的职业生涯就会走向反面。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr48rdtdvj2692xsc3wkznyd))
- Most people overestimate risk and underestimate reward. Taking risks is important because it’s impossible to be right all the time—you have to try many things and adapt quickly as you learn more. 
  大多数人高估了风险，低估了回报。承担风险很重要，因为不可能一直都是正确的--你必须尝试很多事情，并在学到更多知识后迅速适应。
  It’s often easier to take risks early in your career; you don’t have much to lose, and you potentially have a lot to gain. Once you’ve gotten yourself to a point where you have your basic obligations covered you should try to make it easy to take risks. Look for small bets you can make where you lose 1x if you’re wrong but make 100x if it works. Then make a bigger bet in that direction. 
  在职业生涯的早期往往更容易承担风险；你不会有太大的损失，却有可能获得很多好处。一旦你有了一定的能力，能够承担基本的义务，你就应该努力让自己更容易承担风险。寻找你可以下的小赌注，如果你错了，你会损失 1 倍，但如果成功了，你会赚 100 倍。然后朝这个方向下更大的赌注。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr4a0g61ztydtz1xkj28f300))
- Don’t save up for too long, though. At YC, we’ve often noticed a problem with founders that have spent a lot of time working at Google or Facebook. When people get used to a comfortable life, a predictable job, and a reputation of succeeding at whatever they do, it gets very hard to leave that behind (and people have an incredible ability to always match their lifestyle to next year’s salary). Even if they do leave, the temptation to return is great. It’s easy—and human nature—to prioritize short-term gain and convenience over long-term fulfillment.   
  不过，不要攒钱太久。在 YC，我们经常注意到在谷歌或 Facebook 工作了很长时间的创始人的一个问题。当人们习惯了舒适的生活、可预见的工作以及无论做什么都会成功的名声后，就很难将这些抛诸脑后（而且人们有一种不可思议的能力，总能将自己的生活方式与明年的薪水相匹配）。即使他们离开了，回来的诱惑也很大。优先考虑短期利益和便利，而不是长期成就，这很容易，也是人的天性。
  But when you aren’t on the treadmill, you can follow your hunches and spend time on things that might turn out to be really interesting. Keeping your life cheap and flexible for as long as you can is a powerful way to do this, but obviously comes with tradeoffs. 
  但当你不在 "跑步机 "上奔波时，你就可以跟着自己的直觉走，把时间花在可能会非常有趣的事情上。在尽可能长的时间内保持生活的低成本和灵活性，是实现这一目标的有效途径，但显然也要有所取舍。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr49zwbvk7qmfs1v2pnww1ea))

- Focus is a force multiplier on work. 
  专注是工作的倍增器。
  Almost everyone I’ve ever met would be well-served by spending more time thinking about what to focus on. It is much more important to work on the right thing than it is to work many hours. Most people waste most of their time on stuff that doesn’t matter. 
  我所见过的几乎每个人，如果能花更多的时间思考该专注于什么，都会受益匪浅。在正确的事情上工作比工作很多时间要重要得多。大多数人把大部分时间浪费在无关紧要的事情上。
  Once you have figured out what to do, be unstoppable about getting your small handful of priorities accomplished quickly. I have yet to meet a slow-moving person who is very successful. 
  一旦想好了要做什么，就要势不可挡地迅速完成你的一小撮优先事项。我还没见过行动迟缓却非常成功的人。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr4abjb7ckd0he850verw3w5))
- I believe that it’s easier to do a hard startup than an easy startup. People want to be part of something exciting and feel that their work matters.

- People have an enormous capacity to make things happen. A combination of self-doubt, giving up too early, and not pushing hard enough prevents most people from ever reaching anywhere near their potential.

- Almost always, the people who say “I am going to keep going until this works, and no matter what the challenges are I’m going to figure them out”, and mean it, go on to succeed. They are persistent long enough to give themselves a chance for luck to go their way. 
  那些说 "我要坚持下去，直到成功为止，无论遇到什么困难，我都要想办法解决 "的人，几乎总是能够取得成功。他们坚持了足够长的时间，给了自己一个幸运的机会。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr49r2trs44f6q24cn9dhenp))
- To be willful, you have to be optimistic—hopefully this is a personality trait that can be improved with practice. I have never met a very successful pessimistic person.

- The best way to become difficult to compete with is to build up leverage. For example, you can do it with personal relationships, by building a strong personal brand, or by getting good at the intersection of multiple different fields. There are many other strategies, but you have to figure out some way to do it. 
  要想成为难以竞争的对手，最好的办法就是建立影响力。例如，你可以通过人际关系、建立强大的个人品牌，或者在多个不同领域的交叉点上有所建树。还有许多其他策略，但你必须想出一些办法来做到这一点。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr49ngams9kjxfjp0aebdhzf))
- Most people do whatever most people they hang out with do. This mimetic behavior is usually a mistake—if you’re doing the same thing everyone else is doing, you will not be hard to compete with.

- An effective way to build a network is to help people as much as you can. Doing this, over a long period of time, is what lead to most of my best career opportunities and three of my four best investments. I’m continually surprised how often something good happens to me because of something I did to help a founder ten years ago. 
  建立人际网络的有效方法就是尽可能地帮助他人。长期坚持这样做，为我带来了大部分最佳职业机会和四项最佳投资中的三项。我一直很惊讶，因为十年前我帮助过一位创始人，所以经常会有好事发生在我身上。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr49kvc2670k73jz81mxjtsx))
- One of the best ways to build a network is to develop a reputation for really taking care of the people who work with you. Be overly generous with sharing the upside; it will come back to you 10x. Also, learn how to evaluate what people are great at, and put them in those roles. (This is the most important thing I have learned about management, and I haven’t read much about it.) You want to have a reputation for pushing people hard enough that they accomplish more than they thought they could, but not so hard they burn out. 
  建立关系网的最佳方法之一，就是建立起真正照顾与你共事者的声誉。在分享收益时要过于慷慨，这会给你带来 10 倍的回报。此外，还要学会评估员工擅长什么，并让他们担任这些角色。(这是我在管理方面学到的最重要的东西，而我在这方面读到的书并不多）。你要有一个良好的声誉，能给员工足够的压力，让他们取得比想象中更大的成就，但又不至于让他们精疲力竭。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr49mjv54tvpv56tmvgzwejz))
- Everyone is better at some things than others. Define yourself by your strengths, not your weaknesses. Acknowledge your weaknesses and figure out how to work around them, but don’t let them stop you from doing what you want to do. “I can’t do X because I’m not good at Y” is something I hear from entrepreneurs surprisingly often, and almost always reflects a lack of creativity. The best way to make up for your weaknesses is to hire complementary team members instead of just hiring people who are good at the same things you are. 
  每个人在某些方面都比别人强。用你的长处而不是短处来定义你自己。承认你的弱点，并想办法克服它们，但不要让它们阻止你做你想做的事。"我做不了 X，因为我不擅长 Y"，这是我经常从创业者那里听到的一句话，而且几乎总是反映出缺乏创造力。弥补自己弱点的最好办法是雇用互补性强的团队成员，而不是只雇用擅长与自己相同领域的人 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr49j0gr2e9dwy680z3mvn6q))
- A particularly valuable part of building a network is to get good at discovering undiscovered talent. Quickly spotting intelligence, drive, and creativity gets much easier with practice. The easiest way to learn is just to meet a lot of people, and keep track of who goes on to impress you and who doesn’t. Remember that you are mostly looking for rate of improvement, and don’t overvalue experience or current accomplishment. 
  建立人际网络的一个特别重要的部分是善于发现未被发现的人才。通过练习，快速发现智慧、动力和创造力会变得容易得多。最简单的学习方法就是多与人接触，记录谁能给你留下深刻印象，谁不能。记住，你主要是在寻找进步的速度，不要过分看重经验或当前的成就。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr49bzev9nw30h02yd7z7xj3))
- A special case of developing a network is finding someone eminent to take a bet on you, ideally early in your career. The best way to do this, no surprise, is to go out of your way to be helpful. (And remember that you have to pay this forward at some point later!) 
  发展人脉的一个特例是找到知名人士为你下注，最好是在你职业生涯的早期。要做到这一点，最好的办法就是不遗余力地提供帮助。(记住，你必须在以后的某个时刻回报他！）。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr49b6wa4maw6sny73x52xjc))

- The most successful people I know are primarily internally driven; they do what they do to impress themselves and because they feel compelled to make something happen in the world. After you’ve made enough money to buy whatever you want and gotten enough social status that it stops being fun to get more, this is the only force I know of that will continue to drive you to higher levels of performance. 
  据我所知，最成功的人主要是由内在驱动的；他们所做的一切是为了给自己留下深刻印象，因为他们觉得自己必须在这个世界上有所作为。当你赚了足够多的钱，可以买到任何你想要的东西，获得了足够的社会地位，不再觉得获得更多东西是件有趣的事之后，据我所知，这是唯一能继续推动你取得更高水平表现的力量。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr4aq4zk1sp7h987p1g1s6a7))
- Compound growth gets discussed as a financial concept, but it works in careers as well, and it is magic.  A small productivity gain, compounded over 50 years, is worth a lot.  So it’s worth figuring out how to optimize productivity. If you get 10% more done and 1% better every day compared to someone else, the compounded difference is massive.  
  复利增长是一个金融概念，但在职业生涯中也同样有效，而且具有魔力。 生产率的微小提升，经过 50 年的复合增长，就会价值连城。 因此，如何优化生产率值得研究。如果你每天比别人多完成 10%的工作，比别人多做 1%的事情，那么复利差异就是巨大的。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr4vh6smvbg4xh68agw748jr))
- It doesn’t matter how fast you move if it’s in a worthless direction.  Picking the right thing to work on is the most important element of productivity and usually almost ignored.  So think about it more!  Independent thought is hard but it’s something you can get better at with practice. 
  如果方向毫无价值，你走得再快也没用。 选择正确的工作方向是提高工作效率的最重要因素，但通常却几乎被忽视。 所以要多思考！ 独立思考很难，但只要多加练习，就能做得更好。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr4vhf2gr1ys49768s4dbtbg))
- I make sure to leave enough time in my schedule to think about what to work on.  The best ways for me to do this are reading books, hanging out with interesting people, and spending time in nature. 
  我确保在我的日程安排中留出足够的时间来思考该做什么。 对我来说，最好的方法就是看书、和有趣的人一起玩，以及在大自然中度过时光。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr4vp9cghy5dmtzhc3kyy8hv))
- I’ve learned that I can’t be very productive working on things I don’t care about or don’t like.  So I just try not to put myself in a position where I have to do them (by delegating, avoiding, or something else).  Stuff that you don’t like is a painful drag on morale and momentum. 
  我已经意识到，做自己不关心或不喜欢的事情，工作效率不会很高。 因此，我尽量不把自己置于不得不做这些事情的境地（通过委派、回避或其他方式）。 不喜欢的事情会拖累士气和动力，让人痛苦不堪。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr4vrx2kz0m9jg0en6yk1qms))
- By the way, here is an important lesson about delegation: remember that everyone else is also most productive when they’re doing what they like, and do what you’d want other people to do for you—try to figure out who likes (and is good at) doing what, and delegate that way.   
  顺便提一下，这里有一个关于授权的重要经验：请记住，其他人在做自己喜欢的事情时也是最有效率的，做你希望其他人为你做的事情--试着找出谁喜欢（和擅长）做什么，并以此进行授权。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr4vs5wh45bvhavse08tqztw))
- If you find yourself not liking what you’re doing for a long period of time, seriously consider a major job change.  Short-term burnout happens, but if it isn’t resolved with some time off, maybe it’s time to do something you’re more interested in.  
  如果你发现自己长期不喜欢自己正在做的工作，请认真考虑更换一份重要的工作。 短期的倦怠是会发生的，但如果休息一段时间还不能解决，也许是时候做一些你更感兴趣的事情了。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr4vtm5q1473kx2zxy37g8a5))
- I’ve been very fortunate to find work I like so much I’d do it for free, which makes it easy to be really productive.

- It’s important to learn that you can learn anything you want, and that you can get better quickly.  This feels like an unlikely miracle the first few times it happens, but eventually you learn to trust that you can do it. 
  重要的是要知道，你可以学习任何你想学的东西，而且你可以很快变得更好。 这在最初几次发生时感觉就像不可能出现的奇迹，但最终你会学会相信自己能做到。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr4vyj01ecfsewsv2ca8kdq0))
- Doing great work usually requires colleagues of some sort.  Try to be around smart, productive, happy, and positive people that don’t belittle your ambitions.  I love being around people who push me and inspire me to be better.  To the degree you able to, avoid the opposite kind of people—the cost of letting them take up your mental cycles is horrific.  
  出色的工作通常需要某种形式的同事。 尽量与聪明、高效、快乐和积极的人在一起，他们不会贬低你的抱负。 我喜欢和那些推动我、激励我变得更好的人在一起。 在你力所能及的范围内，尽量避开与之相反的人--让他们占据你的精神周期的代价是可怕的。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr4vz2gj4y4k85jahtgk868p))
- You have to both pick the right problem and do the work.  There aren’t many shortcuts.  If you’re going to do something really important, you are very likely going to work both smart and hard.  The biggest prizes are heavily competed for.  This isn’t true in every field (there are great mathematicians who never spend that many hours a week working) but it is in most. 
  你既要选择正确的问题，又要付出努力。 没有多少捷径可走。 如果你要做一件真正重要的事情，你很可能既要聪明又要努力。 最重要的奖项竞争激烈。 这并不是每个领域都是如此（有些伟大的数学家每周工作的时间都没有那么长），但大多数领域都是如此。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr4wp4hqsa7dk3nkc9tqm1p7))
- My system has three key pillars: “Make sure to get the important shit done”, “Don’t waste time on stupid shit”, and “make a lot of lists”. 
  我的系统有三大支柱"确保完成重要的事情"、"不要在愚蠢的事情上浪费时间 "和 "制定大量清单"。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr4w0ydacd0bwtktsnrrkpmy))
- I highly recommend using lists.  I make lists of what I want to accomplish each year, each month, and each day.  Lists are very focusing, and they help me with multitasking because I don’t have to keep as much in my head.  If I’m not in the mood for some particular task, I can always find something else I’m excited to do. 
  我强烈建议大家使用清单。 我把每年、每月和每天要完成的事情列成清单。 清单非常有针对性，能帮助我处理多项任务，因为我不必在脑子里记那么多东西。 如果我没心情做某项任务，我总能找到其他让我兴奋的事情来做。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr4x349fyhdxrs53x4d7mq15))
- I prefer lists written down on paper.  It’s easy to add and remove tasks.  I can access them during meetings without feeling rude.  I re-transcribe lists frequently, which forces me to think about everything on the list and gives me an opportunity to add and remove items. 
  我更喜欢写在纸上的清单。 这样很容易添加和删除任务。 我可以在开会时查阅这些清单，而不会感到无礼。 我经常重新抄写清单，这迫使我思考清单上的每一项内容，让我有机会添加和删除项目。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr4x5rer5g3wedvjaz96npbw))
- I try to prioritize in a way that generates momentum.  The more I get done, the better I feel, and then the more I get done.  I like to start and end each day with something I can really make progress on. 
  我尝试以一种能产生动力的方式来确定优先次序。 做得越多，感觉越好，做得也就越多。 我喜欢每天开始和结束时都做一些能让我真正取得进展的事情。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr4x6jjh9x1g46s7sqdnqj1v))
- I am relentless about getting my most important projects done—I’ve found that if I really want something to happen and I push hard enough, it usually happens.  
  我坚持不懈地完成我最重要的项目--我发现，如果我真的想做某件事情，并且足够努力，它通常就会发生。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr4x6b3kjt9r8nkj4pgqzpqk))
- I have different times of day I try to use for different kinds of work.  The first few hours of the morning are definitely my most productive time of the day, so I don’t let anyone schedule anything then.  I try to do meetings in the afternoon.  I take a break, or switch tasks, whenever I feel my attention starting to fade.  
  我每天都会在不同的时间段安排不同的工作。 早上的前几个小时肯定是我一天中工作效率最高的时候，所以我不会让任何人在这段时间安排任何事情。 我尽量在下午开会。 每当我感觉注意力开始减退时，我就会休息一下，或者切换任务。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr4x9ntnp2vwh3cjtkyt3vn9))
- Also, don’t fall into the trap of productivity porn—chasing productivity for its own sake isn’t helpful.  Many people spend too much time thinking about how to perfectly optimize their system, and not nearly enough asking if they’re working on the right problems.  It doesn’t matter what system you use or if you squeeze out every second if you’re working on the wrong thing. 
  此外，不要掉进为提高生产力而提高生产力的陷阱中。 很多人花了太多时间考虑如何完美优化系统，却没有足够的时间询问自己是否在解决正确的问题。 如果你做的是错误的事情，那么你使用什么系统或者你是否挤出每一秒时间都是无关紧要的。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr4xahgz9zezt67mb98f9ja1))
- Sleep seems to be the most important physical factor in productivity for me.  Some sort of sleep tracker to figure out how to sleep best is helpful.  I’ve found the only thing I’m consistent with are in the set-it-and-forget-it category, and I really like the [Emfit QS+Active](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0158W3E2A/). 
  对我来说，睡眠似乎是影响工作效率最重要的生理因素。某种睡眠追踪器对找出最佳睡眠方式很有帮助。我发现我唯一能坚持使用的是 "设置--忘记--"类型的产品，我非常喜欢 Emfit QS+Active。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr4xd6nqbvrb74j87g876zv2))

- I like a cold, dark, quiet room, and a great mattress (I resisted spending a bunch of money on a great mattress for years, which was stupid—it makes a huge difference to my sleep quality.  I love [this one](https://www.tempurpedic.com/shop-mattresses/tempur-contour-elite/v/715/)).  Not eating a lot in the few hours before sleep helps.  Not drinking alcohol helps a lot, though I’m not willing to do that all the time. 
  我喜欢阴冷、黑暗、安静的房间和一张好床垫（多年来我一直不愿意花大价钱买一张好床垫，这太愚蠢了--它对我的睡眠质量有着巨大的影响。我喜欢这个）。睡前几小时不要吃太多东西。不喝酒也很有帮助，虽然我不愿意一直这样做。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr4xdta9b1yys3dny15x84m2))

- I use a full spectrum LED light most mornings for about 10-15 minutes while I catch up on email.  It’s great—if you try nothing else in here, this is the thing I’d try.  It’s a ridiculous gain for me.  I like [this one](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B075H39NDL/), and it’s easy to travel with. 
  每天早上，我都会使用全光谱 LED 灯，大约 10-15 分钟，同时处理电子邮件。它很棒--如果你在这里什么都不做，我也会试试这个。对我来说，它的收益高得离谱。我喜欢这个，而且便于携带。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr50a1krshe4jzca4vkwdacx))
- Exercise is probably the second most important physical factor.  I tried a number of different exercise programs for a few months each and the one that seemed best was lifting heavy weights 3x a week for an hour, and high intensity interval training occasionally.  In addition to productivity gains, this is also the exercise program that makes me feel the best overall.   
  运动可能是第二重要的身体因素。 我尝试了许多不同的锻炼计划，每个计划都持续了几个月，其中看起来最好的是每周 3 次、每次一小时的举重锻炼，以及偶尔进行的高强度间歇训练。 除了提高生产力外，这也是让我整体感觉最好的运动项目。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr50ayw46x8kxnnx0vpcetsr))

- Don’t neglect your family and friends for the sake of productivity—that’s a very stupid tradeoff (and very likely a net productivity loss, because you’ll be less happy).  Don’t neglect doing things you love or that clear your head either.
