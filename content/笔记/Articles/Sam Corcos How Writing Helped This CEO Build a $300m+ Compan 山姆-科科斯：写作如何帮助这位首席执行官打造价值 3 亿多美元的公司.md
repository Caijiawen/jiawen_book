- I'd say broadly speaking, the amount of thought that has to go into something should be roughly proportional to the degree, to the importance of the thing that you're doing. So we don't make everyone write everything down. 
  我想说的是，从广义上讲，思考的程度应该与你所做事情的重要性成正比。因此，我们不会让每个人都把所有事情都写下来。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hx1fzyva9vvzgg9phhh1b4zr))
- Like this is a thing that programmers experience all the time. It's like, You get a bad set of instructions, you get some bad specs, you build a thing for two, three months, and they go, oh, yeah, we don't need that anymore. Just delete it. 
  这是程序员经常遇到的情况。就好比，你得到了一套糟糕的指令，你得到了一些糟糕的规格，你做了两三个月的东西，然后他们就会说，哦，是的，我们不再需要这个了。删掉就是了。

  It's like, I could have been on vacation for three months. That would have been better for all of us if I just did nothing. But instead of just building a thing that we didn't even ship, I should have just been in Hawaii. 
  这就好比，我本可以去度假三个月。如果我什么都不做，对大家都好但我应该去夏威夷，而不是只造一个 我们甚至都没运过的东西。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hx1gpmg9ejf3181h65e380nk))
- If you are not capable of communicating, it doesn't matter how good you are, per se, at your technical role. If you can't communicate, it's going to be very, very hard to do, especially at a remote company. 
  如果你不善于沟通，那么无论你的技术能力有多强都没有用。如果你不会沟通，那就很难做好工作，尤其是在一家远程公司。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hx1h1yeteks7q7k1mwzs27ed))
