- Q: Is relationship dissatisfaction caused by comparing oneself to others in a performative culture? 
  问：在表演文化中，人际关系中的不满情绪是否源于与他人的比较？
  A: Yes, in a performative culture, people often seek validation from others and compare themselves to others, leading to a constant evaluation of their level of happiness in relationships. This can result in relationship dissatisfaction as individuals base their happiness on external perceptions rather than true satisfaction within the relationship. 
  答：是的，在表演性文化中，人们经常会寻求他人的肯定，并将自己与他人进行比较，从而不断评估自己在人际关系中的幸福程度。这会导致人际关系的不满意，因为人们会把自己的幸福感建立在外界的看法上，而不是人际关系中的真正满意度上。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hyd4rjm5vmynepacmzz6xjja))
