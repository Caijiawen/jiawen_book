- Category: #articles
- Summary: The article discusses a method for acquiring, retaining, and applying knowledge through visual note-taking using a tool called Heptabase. The author outlines a five-step process that includes highlighting important paragraphs while reading, dissecting the content into granular concepts, mapping relationships between concepts, grouping similar concepts together, and integrating newly learned concepts with previously known ones. The author emphasizes the importance of atomizing notes and ensuring clarity by describing each concept in one sentence and using that sentence as the title of the concept card. The article concludes by highlighting the significance of choosing the right tool for effective learning.

## Highlights
- The purpose of visualizing notes is to gain a deep understanding of what you've learned. If all of your notes are very long and you don't break down the knowledge into smaller parts, the understanding you can gain from visualization will be very limited. Real deep understanding doesn't come from the "relationship between two books" but from the "relationship between all the concepts in these two books."
  You can only gain a deep understanding of the topics you care about through visual note-taking when you atomize your notes. Atomic note-taking does not mean you cannot have long notes. It means that each concept card should only contain one concept and be supported by its content. To ensure clarity, you should always describe the concept in one sentence and use that sentence as the title of the concept card.

- I have met many people who face the same problem in learning, and this issue is what many note-taking (a.k.a. knowledge management) tools are trying to solve. Unfortunately, most of these tools put too much focus on how you store your notes (e.g., folders, graphs, relational databases, etc.) and neglect important aspects of learning such as **acquisition** (making sense of knowledge), **retention** (recalling past knowledge), and **application** (applying knowledge in a real-world scenario).

- The famous Feynman learning technique suggests that the best way to develop a deep understanding of a topic is to teach it to a child. I would say that whenever you want to teach something, you need to first **figure out the structure of the knowledge and be able to articulate that structure clearly.** The method that I developed can help you achieve that with five steps:
  1. Highlight all important paragraphs while reading.
  2. Dissect the content of a book into granular concepts.
  3. Map the relationships between these concepts.
  4. Group similar concepts together.
  5. Integrate these newly learned concepts with previously known concepts. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk1b6nbwc8y5danw1bx5yq0p))
- Simply creating a concept card is not enough. To ensure clarity, **I always describe the concept in one sentence and use that sentence as the title of the concept card.** Then, I reorganize the content of the card into a structure that makes sense to me, and perhaps even drag other related blocks from the original book card into this concept card.

Real deep understanding doesn't come from the "relationship between two books" but from the "relationship between all the concepts in these two books."** What you want to connect are not book cards, but individual concept cards that you extract from these books using the previous four steps.
