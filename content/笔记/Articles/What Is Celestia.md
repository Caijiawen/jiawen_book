- Category: #articles
- Summary: Celestia is a modular data availability (DA) network that allows anyone to launch their own blockchain. It is used by rollups and layer 2s to publish and make transaction data available for download. Data availability sampling (DAS) is a technology that allows Celestia light nodes to efficiently verify the data. Rollups on Celestia, known as sovereign rollups, offer convenience and security. Modular blockchains, like Celestia, specialize in specific functions and collaborate with other chains. The vision of Celestia is to empower sovereign communities and promote modularism over maximalism.

## Highlights
- Celestia is a modular data availability (DA) network that securely scales with the number of users, making it easy for anyone to launch their own blockchain.
  Rollups and L2s use Celestia as a network for publishing and making transaction data available for anyone to download. For them, Celestia provides high-throughput DA that can be verified easily with a light node.
  And by making the blockchain stack modular, anyone can launch their own blockchain without needing a validator set. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkydghtyn5dtyj50p24cgn5b))
- Data availability answers the question, has the data for this blockchain been published? It is critical to the security of any blockchain because it ensures that anyone can inspect the ledger of transactions and verify it. 
  数据可用性回答的问题是：这个区块链的数据是否已经公布？这对任何区块链的安全性都至关重要，因为它能确保任何人都能检查交易账簿并进行验证。
  Users of a monolithic blockchain usually download all the data to check that it is available. 
  单体区块链的用户通常会下载所有数据，以检查数据是否可用。
  As blocks get bigger, it becomes impractical for normal users to download all the data meaning that they can’t verify the chain. Modular chains solve this problem by making it possible for users to verify very large blocks using a technology called data availability sampling. 
  随着区块越来越大，普通用户下载所有数据变得不切实际，这意味着他们无法验证链。模块化链解决了这一问题，用户可以使用一种名为数据可用性采样的技术来验证超大区块。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkyde5psd30abqzb34brea0w))
- Data availability sampling (DAS) is the new primitive that enables Celestia light nodes to verify DA efficiently. Instead of downloading all data, light nodes only download a tiny portion of each block.
  Importantly, DAS allows Celestia to scale with the number of users (light nodes). So, as the light node network grows over time, Celestia can scale to the data throughput needed for millions of rollups without compromising on security for end users.
