## Highlights
- If say there's like a hundred million people who recognize this meme, like instantly like that, if a hundred million people are like buying what $1, $10, $100, $1,000, that's a lot of buying pressure just on whatever meme or memecoin, 
  如果说有一亿人认出了这个备忘录，就像当场认出了它一样，如果有一亿人买了 1 美元、10 美元、100 美元、1000 美元，那不管是什么备忘录或备忘录币，都会有很大的购买压力、

  whatever you want to call it. I think it's more of like an attention thing and like an internet thing than it is really like thinking about teams that are building out products. 
  不管你怎么称呼它。我认为，这更像是一种关注，更像是一种互联网思维，而不是真正意义上的打造产品的团队思维。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxavv185t1mbsvcqwq9kqt5j))
- I think you hit most of the major points. Ultimately, the winning trade business idea, crypto or otherwise, in the last 20 years has been on attention, right? 
  我认为你说到了大部分要点。归根结底，在过去 20 年里，无论是加密货币还是其他货币，获胜的贸易经营理念都是注意力，对吗？
  08:08
  All of these trillion dollar businesses, be it Facebook or whatever, a trillion or almost at a trillion, what do they do? They facilitate the directing attention, right? 
  所有这些价值万亿美元的企业，不管是 Facebook 还是其他什么，都有万亿美元或几乎达到万亿美元，它们是做什么的？它们促进了注意力的引导，对吗？
  08:22
  And the way that they've done that super successfully has been oftentimes via memes. One could even make the argument that memes are the core engine of the entire internet. 
  而他们超级成功地做到这一点的方式，往往就是通过 "备忘录"。甚至可以说，备忘录是整个互联网的核心引擎。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxavvdr12rfc03329r5vrchm))
- And one of my better trades this year was Bonk in the early days, because there wasn't a lot of activity or other alts on Chain that you could buy. So I was like, you bought Solana. And then it's like, okay, what else do I buy on Chain? 
  今年我做得比较好的一笔交易是早期的 Bonk，因为当时 Chain 上没有什么活动，也没有其他可以买到的 alts。所以我就想，你买了索拉娜。然后我就想，好吧，那我还能在 Chain 上买什么呢？
  10:40
  I want to get beta to Solana. So I was like, okay, Bonk is one of the only other coins on Chain. It just happened to be a memecoin. And WIF in like the same way, just done really well. 
  我想获得索拉纳的测试版。所以我就想，好吧，Bonk 是 Chain 上仅有的其他币之一。它只是碰巧是一个memecoin。WIF也是一样，只是做得非常好。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxavyaewhq97jz3x5wkmvta5))
- you know, this tech versus that tech and, you know, this nuance versus this interest rate, and then you just get drastically outperformed by a guy who just bought every dog. 
  你知道，这种技术与那种技术的对比，你知道，这种细微差别与这种利率的对比，然后你就会被一个买下所有狗的人大幅超越。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxavzw3z9c5xdkrhnjt9dg2w))
- And then within that, you can narrow it down to what are people actually going to, you know, get excited about? What can a large number of people all get behind? 
  然后在此基础上，你可以将范围缩小到什么是人们真正会，你知道，感到兴奋的？什么能得到众多人的支持？
  15:58
  It turns out that the simplest answer to that question is the correct answer, which is stuff that makes them laugh, right? It's a lot easier to say, I'm gonna punt. 
  事实证明，这个问题最简单的答案就是正确答案，也就是能让他们发笑的东西，对吗？说 "我不干了 "就简单多了。
  16:07
  $100 or $1,000 or if you're one of these whales, $100,000, whatever the case may be, 
  100美元或1000美元，如果你是这些鲸鱼中的一员，10万美元，不管是什么情况 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxaw8d35vd7n68fkazf913b9))
- I was like, okay, what am I doing when I'm actually looking at these and thinking which ones are going to go up? I kind of centered on three main things, I would say. I'd say the first thing is the relatability. 
  我当时想，好吧，当我真的在看这些东西并思考哪些会上涨时，我在做什么？我主要从三个方面来考虑。第一点是亲和力。
  17:02
  How relatable is the meme to anybody in the world, regardless of if they know what crypto is, whatever their background, what doesn't really matter? How relatable is this picture or video or whatever it is, the meme, to somebody? 
  对于世界上的任何人来说，无论他们是否知道加密货币是什么，无论他们的背景如何，这都不重要。这张图片或视频或其他任何东西，对某个人来说有多大的亲和力？
  17:14
  I think one of the reasons that Doge did super well when Elon was pushing it crazy hard last cycle is because it's just a dog. It's just a dog coin. It's a coin and a dog. 
  我认为，当埃隆在上一轮疯狂推动 Doge 时，Doge 表现出色的原因之一就是它只是一只狗。这只是一枚狗币。这是一枚硬币和一只狗。
  17:23
  It's very easy for anybody to understand and make that connection there, even if you didn't know what crypto is. Okay, Dogecoin, I'll buy $10 worth of That's why you always see these memes of animals. It's because everybody loves animals. 
  即使你不知道加密货币是什么 任何人都很容易理解并建立联系好吧，Dogecoin，我买10美元的 这就是为什么你总能看到这些动物的备忘录。因为每个人都喜欢动物
  17:35
  So it's like, you don't need to understand what blockchain is, what like L2 is, like, you don't need to know any of that to under like, okay, it's a cute picture of whatever. 
  所以，你不需要了解什么是区块链，什么是 L2，你不需要知道任何这些，就能明白，好吧，这是一张可爱的图片。
  17:45
  So I say relatability is really important because that like get the total addressable market like of holders is that you want that to be as wide as possible. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxayjya1hwkgsxhwb9062byy))
- And then I would say the second piece of it is the distribution piece of it. 
  因此，我认为关联性真的很重要，因为这就像获得总的可寻址市场一样，你希望持有者的范围越广越好。然后，我要说的第二件事就是分销。
  17:58
  So a lot of these coins, they all have devs launching them, right? The ones that do really well are typically the ones where the dev either sold all their coins or the team who launched the token early sold all their coins really early. 
  很多代币都是由开发者推出的，对吗？做得非常好的通常是那些开发者要么卖掉了他们所有的币，要么是早期推出代币的团队很早就卖掉了他们所有的币。
  18:11
  The reason that is a common denominator with a lot of the memes that go to billions plus is because there's not an overhang of supply with people who have way more than everybody else. 
  这也是许多 "十亿以上 "备忘录的一个共同点，原因在于那些比其他人拥有更多财富的人并不存在供应过剩的问题。
  18:22
  So it's like if you have a very wide distribution where there's nobody who holds 10% of the coin or like 20% of the coin, 
  因此，这就好比你有一个非常广泛的分布，没有人持有 10%或 20%的硬币、
  18:28
  and everybody owns the max is like 1-2%, you can't have like one individual basically capping the upside of the token in its early days, 
  而每个人拥有的最大份额只有 1-2%，因此不能让一个人在代币发行初期就为其上涨空间设置上限、
  18:36
  which is the most important period for any of these memes is like the early period where you form the community. Get X amount of holders. 
  对于任何这些备忘录来说，最重要的时期就是组建社区的初期。获得 X 数量的持有者。
  18:45
  You want as many holders as possible in as early as possible because that's how you have this cult community form around whatever meme. And you've seen it happen with WIF. You've seen it happen with Pepe. 
  你希望尽可能多的持有者尽早加入，因为这样才能形成一个围绕任何主题的崇拜社区。你已经在 WIF 身上看到了这一点。佩佩也是如此。
  18:55
  There's people who literally bought 100K, 200K market cap, and they're just like, oh, I'm not selling. I've been in this forever. I've taken some profit on the way up, but I'm holding my portion of the supply that I have. 
  有些人真的买了 10 万、20 万市值的股票，他们就想，哦，我不卖了。我一直都在买。我已经在上涨过程中获利了一些，但我还持有我的那部分货源。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxaypb2e60eea6xsmpe5jbj5))
- And then the third thing I would say is the virality aspect of it. 
  第三点是病毒性。
  19:10
  So even if you have something that's really relatable, something that has good distribution, there still needs to be a way that the meme goes viral and other people learn about it. 
  因此，即使你有一些非常贴近生活、传播效果很好的东西，也需要有一种方法让备忘录病毒式传播，让其他人了解它。
  19:18
  And I would say a lot of times that's when you have the KOL influencer, all that, people who have a ton of followers. 
  我想说的是，很多时候，当你拥有 KOL 影响者时，所有这些人都拥有大量粉丝。
  19:27
  It's because that's how you get distribution to a lot of people like really quickly is because a ton of people just see it. Like a lot of more people just have eyes on it immediately. 
  因为这样你就能很快地向很多人传播，因为很多人都看到了。更多的人立刻就能看到它。
  19:38
  And I think the reason Doge went to almost 100 billion market cap last cycle during COVID is because Elon is literally the richest person on the planet. Everybody knows who Elon is. Elon's like, I'm buying Doge. 
  我认为，Doge 在上一轮 COVID 期间市值达到近千亿美元的原因是，埃隆是这个星球上最富有的人。每个人都知道埃隆是谁。埃隆说，我要买下 Doge。
  19:50
  I love Dogecoin nonstop, week to week. So everybody saw it. Everybody on earth saw that. So it was just like the potential for it to go viral was just massive. So I would say those are like the three main things. 
  我不停地爱着 Dogecoin，周而复始。所以每个人都看到了。地球人都看到了所以它的传播潜力是巨大的所以我想说这是最主要的三件事 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxayqfex75x9rae6mbne8gts))
- And also like looking, probably the fourth I would say if I had to pick one was like how the community organizes like on socials or like on Twitter or whatever other platforms. 
  如果非要选一个的话，我觉得第四个可能是社区如何在社交平台、推特或其他平台上组织起来。
  20:25
  Like one of the reasons that I saw WIF super early is because people were just spamming me with the like dog editing the hat or whatever else on everybody's profile pictures all across crypto Twitter and in my telegram like all over the place or a ton of people just not stop doing that. 
  我之所以很早就看到了 WIF，其中一个原因就是人们总是在我的加密推特和电报中，在每个人的个人主页图片上用狗编辑帽子或其他什么东西向我发送垃圾邮件，到处都是这样的图片，或者说有很多人都在不停地这样做。
  20:39
  Okay, I keep seeing this. Maybe I should buy some of this coin. So I'll say those are like the main how I think about it generally. 
  好吧，我一直在看这个。也许我应该买一些这种硬币。这些就是我的主要想法 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxayrjny4f0wwa39k81ydm80))
- And so each individual person, regardless if they have $5 in WIF or 500,000, They could spread it to a nearly infinite number of people because any meme could become a WIF meme. 
  因此，每个人，无论他们在 WIF 中的存款是 5 美元还是 50 万美元，他们都可以将其传播给几乎无限多的人，因为任何备忘录都可以成为 WIF 的备忘录。
  22:49
  And so when you're evaluating the incremental, the next meme investment, a question you might ask is how easy is it? For any given holder, not only to relate to this, to Ansem's earlier point, but to then also extend upon this. 
  因此，当你在评估增量、下一个meme投资时，你可能会问一个问题：这有多容易？对于任何特定的持有者来说，不仅要与此相关，与安森先前的观点相关，还要在此基础上进行延伸。
  23:07
  And I think that can give you insight to the degree of upside that this meme has, at the very least, from a how many people will like this or use this perspective. And whether or not that translates financially is a different question. 
  我认为，至少从有多少人会喜欢或使用这个主题的角度来看，这可以让你了解到这个主题的上升空间有多大。至于能否转化为经济效益，那就是另外一个问题了。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxayzabbj0js50qw8mtczt22))
- So if something is only really interesting or funny or generally attractive to a small subset of people on crypto Twitter, 
  因此，如果某些东西只对加密推特上的一小部分人非常有趣、滑稽或具有普遍吸引力、
  27:39
  Then it's upside is pretty capped to the small percentage of money that those people are each individually willing to put into that meme. And so maybe it can only go to 10 million or 50 million or 100 million market cap. 
  那么，它的上升空间就会被限制在这些人各自愿意投入到该备忘录中的一小部分资金。因此，也许它的市值只能达到 1000 万、5000 万或 1 亿。
  27:54
  Whereas stuff like Doge, which has appealed to anyone who likes dogs generally, is much more unbounded to... Coins like Doge and Chiba, I'm pretty sure they have like, you know, millions of holders, right? 
  而像Doge这样的钱币，对所有喜欢狗的人都有吸引力，但对......却没有限制。像Doge和Chiba这样的硬币 我很确定它们有数百万的持有者，对吧？ ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxaz1npm3vapjscr3xawxh32))
- I think Solana is really good for retail in general because it's super cheap for anybody to buy. There's really no obstacles for anybody who can buy and sell memes on Solana. 
  我认为索拉纳对零售业非常有利，因为任何人都可以以超低价购买。对任何人来说，在索拉纳上买卖备忘录都没有任何障碍。
  31:57
  Whereas with ETH, I remember when I was selling Pepe on Chain, when it was close to the top, I was paying like a hundred plus, like $200, like every transaction just to push them through because it was so much activity, 
  而对于 ETH，我记得当我在 Chain 上出售佩佩时，当它接近顶峰时，我每笔交易都要支付 100 多美元，比如 200 美元，只是为了把它们推过去，因为它的活跃度太高了、
  32:09
  so many people buying and selling so much on so much volume on Chain. Whereas with Solana, you don't really have those issues. Like I've seen people literally dollar cost average $1 buys for like days on coins. 
  有这么多人在 Chain 上大量买卖。而在索拉纳，就不会有这些问题。我就见过有人以平均 1 美元的成本，连续好几天买入钱币。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxaz6c58z9nc92ctd7y3evkq))
- But I think they may be considering doing that now if there's like altcoins on Bitcoin or like JPEGs on Bitcoin. So I think like compared to ETH and Solana, 
  但我认为，如果比特币上出现了另类币，或者比特币上出现了 JPEGs，他们现在可能会考虑这么做。所以我认为，与 ETH 和 Solana 相比、
  33:07
  the wealth effect is just massive on Bitcoin if you can tap into those like people who have been in crypto for a really long period of time. 
  比特币的财富效应是巨大的，如果你能像那些长期持有加密货币的人一样利用它。
  33:14
  And that's like kind of why like Wizard And I like pups because I think if you can get those people interested, then the ceiling obviously is just going to be higher because you have a ton of money on Bitcoin. 
  这就是为什么我喜欢向导，喜欢小狗的原因，因为我觉得如果你能让这些人感兴趣，那么上限显然会更高，因为你在比特币上有一大笔钱。
  33:26
  That's generally how I think about it. But I would say the degens are active on every single chain. Like if you're a good trader in crypto, you're on every chain, like regardless. 
  我一般就是这么想的。但我想说的是，Degens 活跃在每一条链上。就像如果你是一个优秀的加密货币交易者，你就会在每一条链上，无论如何。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxaz7nrpt79j7awrkge2fe87))
- Obviously, we've seen the scope and lasting nature of the opportunities on Solana far outweighed, you know, a lot of competing chains, at least with respect to memecoins. That said, you know, I've also had a lot of activity on base. 
  很明显，我们看到索拉纳的机会范围和持久性远远超过了，你知道，很多竞争链，至少在memecoins方面。话虽如此，你知道，我在基地也有很多活动。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxaz944fwkxn552v614zg2pj))
- Of the UX unlock of runes weren't really met at least yet, but it is still very early days. This is still quite new tech, so definitely optimistic down the line, but as of right now, I'd definitely say Solana by far always. 
  至少在用户体验方面，符文的解锁还没有真正实现，但现在还为时尚早。这仍然是一项相当新的技术，因此肯定会有乐观的发展前景，但就目前而言，我肯定会说索拉娜始终是最棒的。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxaz996cbd2e7hzx0zgexqbe))
- For somebody who bought $100 worth of Bitcoin and $100 worth of Doge in 2014 or whatever it was, it's really no difference to them what they made or what the coin is. They made as much money on either of them. 
  对于那些在 2014 年或其他什么时候买了 100 美元比特币和 100 美元 Doge 的人来说，他们赚了多少钱或者买了什么币对他们来说真的没什么区别。他们在这两种币上赚的钱一样多。
  40:13
  I think a lot of people miss that. These things actually hold value. Doge was top 10 in the bear market. And it did a lot better as far as returns and then all the DeFi coins did, which people think are a lot more serious than the memes. 
  我想很多人都忽略了这一点。这些东西实际上是有价值的。Doge 在熊市中排名前十。就回报率而言，它比所有的 DeFi 硬币都要好得多，人们认为 DeFi 硬币比备忘录要严肃得多。
  40:31
  It outperformed a ton of other serious projects. But it's hard for people to get in that mental state, framing that these memes have value. It's easy for me because I've been on the internet forever. 
  它的表现超过了很多其他严肃项目。但人们很难进入这种心理状态，认为这些备忘录有价值。这对我来说很容易，因为我一直在互联网上。
  40:43
  I've been looking at memes since I was eight, nine. Memes have always been around. 
  我从八、九岁起就开始看备忘录。备忘录一直存在。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxazbfwa1d32824nea9bzbek))
- whether it's like Stocks, crypto, altcoins, Bitcoin, Ethereum, any of those things, people can buy the top and lose money. That's not really a specific-to-memecoins thing. 
  无论是股票、加密货币、另类币、比特币、以太坊，任何一种东西，人们都有可能买在最前面，然后赔钱。这并不是纪念币特有的现象。
  42:10
  And even how far they go down, a lot of the DeFi coins went down 90% in the same way that memes went down a lot. I would say a better criticism around memes is the shady behavior with teams launching them. 
  就连它们下跌的幅度，很多 DeFi 硬币都下跌了 90%，而 memes 也下跌了很多。我想说的是，围绕memes的更好的批评是推出memes的团队的不正当行为。
  42:26
  Controlling a ton of the supply and literally just like P&Ding them as soon as they launch. You launch a coin, show it to some people, literally sell like 50 plus percent of the supply immediately on launch and then it just goes to zero. 
  控制着大量的供应，就像一推出就会被抢购一样。你推出一枚硬币，向一些人展示，推出后立即售出 50% 以上的供应量，然后就归零了。
  42:39
  I'd say that's like the better criticism because that happens a ton with these projects that literally start from zero. There's no really rules or anything around like how you launch. 
  我想说这是更好的批评，因为这种情况经常发生在这些从零开始的项目中。没有真正的规则或任何关于如何启动的东西。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxazfd889fqf1zq3q63qfwb7))
- Yeah, I mean, I do think it's a good idea to have some kind of rules around it. I think one of the reasons that Pump.Fund has been doing well, it's like It allows anybody to launch a coin immediately like that, 
  是啊，我的意思是，我认为这是一个好主意 周围有某种规则。我认为，Pump.Fund能做得这么好的原因之一，就是它允许任何人像这样立即发行一个币、
  44:11
  made a ton of revenue in the past 30 days, because literally just upload a picture, give it a ticker, give it a description, and then it lands on this bonding curve. 
  在过去的 30 天里，我们获得了大量的收入，因为只需上传一张图片，给它一个标签，给它一个描述，然后它就会出现在这个粘合曲线上。
  44:20
  And then once enough people buy on the bonding curve, I think they take a cut of that and put it in a liquidity pool, and they launch it on Radium or whatever it is. But the good thing about those coins on Pump.Fund is none of them can rug. 
  然后，一旦有足够多的人在粘合曲线上购买，我想他们就会从中抽取一部分，并将其放入流动性池中，然后在镭或其他什么平台上推出。不过，Pump.Fund 上的这些币的好处是，它们都不会垮掉。
  44:31
  You can't rug any of them because it immediately locks the LP or whatever it is. 
  你不能用地毯擦它们，因为它会立即锁定 LP 或其他什么东西。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxazkkxf92v5tx6326q9jzac))
- And with Solana, you know, Solana is going up a lot, but nothing in the ecosystem had really performed super well. And so that's what I had been looking for, is like the second order trade going off of Solana. 
  你知道，索拉纳的价格上涨了很多，但生态系统中没有任何东西表现得非常好。因此，这就是我一直在寻找的，从 Solana 开始的二阶交易。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxaztywn598dw84q2ygcb68f))
- And that's why it was able to reach escape velocity because a lot of those early holders in Bitcoin just had such strong conviction, almost to a religious To the extent that Bitcoin was worth way, way, way more, 
  这就是为什么比特币能达到逃逸速度的原因 因为很多早期的比特币持有者都有强烈的信念，几乎到了宗教的程度 认为比特币的价值要高得多，高得多，高得多、
  1:03:39
  would be worth way, way more in the future. But if you ask anybody what Bitcoin's value was back in 2012 or whenever, they would say the exact same thing that people say about memecoins now. 
  比特币在未来会更值钱。但是，如果你问任何人，比特币在 2012 年或其他时候的价值是多少，他们会说和现在人们对memecoins 的评价一模一样。
  1:03:51
  The quotes would literally be the exact same quotes. Like, oh, it's just fake internet money. It's just made up. It's not worth anything. It's like rat poison. 
  引文简直就是一模一样的引文。就像，哦，这只是假的互联网资金。只是编出来的根本不值钱就像老鼠药
  1:03:59
  All of those quotes that people say about Bitcoin back then are what people say about memes now. But you wouldn't say that about memes on the internet. 
  当年人们对比特币的评价，就是现在人们对备忘录的评价。但在互联网上，你不会这么说备忘录。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxb062wppksydyq0ywa0xzrs))
- There's kind of these historical artifacts type of things, like memes on the internet that are going to get turned into coins. 
  有一种历史文物类型的东西，就像互联网上的备忘录，会被变成硬币。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxb08gbc06z9t09ax64amqbq))
- I think what's going to happen is you're going to have NFT projects, which are just like also memes. And you've kind of seen this a little bit happen with the 404 standard on ETH, 
  我认为即将发生的事情是，你将会有 NFT 项目，这些项目就像 "备忘录 "一样。你已经在 ETH 的 404 标准中看到了这一点、
  1:10:15
  I think, where it's like you have You have the JPEGs and then when you fractionalize the JPEGs, you just get coins. So it's like you can either hold one of the JPEGs or you can hold like a fractionalized version of that JPEG as a coin. 
  我认为，这就像你有了 JPEG，然后当你把 JPEG 分割时，你就得到了硬币。因此，你既可以持有其中一张 JPEG 文件，也可以持有该 JPEG 文件的一个小部分作为硬币。
  1:10:27
  I think that standard, it may not be 404 specifically, but that trend I think is going to continue to be really popular because you have the aspect of altcoins where it's like you can have a ton more holders. 
  我认为，这种标准可能不会具体到 404，但我认为这种趋势会继续流行下去，因为你可以拥有更多的持有者。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxb09ddcce1dk5449w1n7g9n))
