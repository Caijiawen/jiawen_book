## Highlights
- 如果特朗普赢得选举，他将在 SEC 中找到一个对加密货币更加有利的人。我们可以讨论并深入探讨这意味着什么。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j1y78q4rbnq8nvnphnfap5x8))
- This clock has not started with the S1s. The S1s is basically what those Ethereum ETFs, which we'll talk about in a bit, are going through right now. 
  该时钟尚未随 S1 启动。 S1 基本上就是那些我们稍后会讨论的以太坊 ETF 目前正在经历的事情。

  The 19B4 documents are what these issuers, they'll partner with an exchange and they'll file those. Once those are filed and the SEC accepts them, that's when the clock starts. 
  19B4 文件是这些发行人的文件，他们将与交易所合作并提交这些文件。一旦这些文件被提交并且美国证券交易委员会接受它们，那么时间就开始了。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j1y7w9wf5ta58hye3pt56wye))

  So assuming like even if they filed today, the final deadline for these Solana ETFs is going to be sometime around March 17th, 18th-ish range. So we're still looking at a ways out before we even get a final deadline. 
  因此，假设即使他们今天提交申请，这些 Solana ETF 的最终截止日期也将是 3 月 17 日至 18 日左右的某个时间。因此，在确定最后期限之前，我们仍在寻找出路。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j1y7x3rk2an0z1w2tjd8vzr6))
- Or you get a completely new admin, Trump wins the election and puts somebody who's just so pro-crypto that they let this happen. In March. So I still think it's unlike even if Trump wins, I think it's unlikely to happen in March. 
  或者你得到了一个全新的政府，特朗普赢得了选举，并任命了一个非常支持加密货币的人，以至于他们让这种情况发生。三月。所以我还是觉得不像特朗普就算赢了，我觉得三月份也不太可能发生。

  But if Trump wins, I think 2025 is on the table, depending on what he does at the SEC. That said, when Gary Gensler was going to the SEC, I was like, oh, we're definitely getting Bitcoin ETFs. This dude is teaching blockchain. 
  但如果特朗普获胜，我认为 2025 年就会到来，这取决于他在 SEC 的表现。也就是说，当加里·根斯勒 (Gary Gensler) 去美国证券交易委员会 (SEC) 时，我就想，哦，我们肯定会获得比特币 ETF。这家伙正在教授区块链。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j1y81hqjqnrgaw5d50f5zag9))
- The post that GCR put out was, If a spot ETF gets approved, there's an 8.9X potential increase in Solana's price, right? 
  GCR 发布的帖子是，如果现货 ETF 获得批准，Solana 的价格可能会上涨 8.9 倍，对吗？ ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j1y84m7n93r5h8780zeaf6q1))
- Like you're up competing against BlackRock and Fidelity, which are two of the biggest asset managers, not just in the US, but just flat out in the world with like massive reach. And you got to kind of push the envelope. 
  就像你要与贝莱德和富达竞争一样，这两家公司是最大的资产管理公司，不仅在美国，而且在全世界都有同样巨大的影响力。你必须挑战极限。
  12:31
  If you want to compete with them, you got to be first. Right. Lately, the SEC has basically been forcing everyone to launch at the same time. I suspect at some point that's got to stop because that's not how they've handled other things. 
  如果你想和他们竞争，你就必须成为第一。正确的。最近，美国证券交易委员会基本上强迫所有人同时推出。我怀疑在某些时候这种情况必须停止，因为这不是他们处理其他事情的方式。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j1y8aq7dfqq8s8eb0rxsfdc0))
- So if Trump wins and holds his promises, right, to be bullish crypto and take care of crypto, anything can happen in 2025. Who knows? 
  因此，如果特朗普获胜并兑现他的承诺，看好加密货币并照顾好加密货币，那么 2025 年任何事情都可能发生。谁知道呢？ ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j1y8bpc4r5cja13nhmtcfdcf))
- But what was also interesting to me is that both the Bowdoin and Trump meme coins plummeted during the debate. It was kind of like a sell the news for both candidates. So I don't think the meme coins were actually a strong signal. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j1y8jz7saebrjpkgr8pcp9vy))
