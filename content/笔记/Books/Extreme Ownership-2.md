## Highlights
- Some of the boldest, most successful plans in history have not come from the senior ranks but from frontline leaders. Senior leaders simply had the courage to accept and run with them.
- The Dichotomy of Leadership
  领导力的二分法
  A good leader must be:
  一个好的领导者必须是：
  • confident but not cocky;
  - 自信但不自大；
  • courageous but not foolhardy;
  - 勇敢但不愚蠢；
  • competitive but a gracious loser;
  - 有竞争力，但却是一个亲切的失败者；
  • attentive to details but not obsessed by them;
  - 关注细节，但不为其所迷惑；
  • strong but have endurance;
  - 坚强但有耐力；
  • a leader and follower;
  - 一个领导者和追随者；
  • humble not passive;
  - 谦虚而不消极；
  • aggressive not overbearing;
  - 咄咄逼人，不卑不亢；
  • quiet not silent;
  - 安静不是沉默；
  • calm but not robotic, logical but not devoid of emotions;
  - 平静但不是机器人，有逻辑但不是没有感情；
  • close with the troops but not so close that one becomes more important than another or more important than the good of the team; not so close that they forget who is in charge.
  - 与部队关系密切，但不至于亲密到一个人比另一个人更重要或比团队的利益更重要；不至于亲密到忘记谁是负责人。
  • able to execute Extreme Ownership, while exercising Decentralized Command.
  - 能够执行极端的所有权，同时行使分散的指挥权。
  A good leader has nothing to prove, but everything to prove.
  一个好的领导者没有什么需要证明的，但却要证明一切。
- 由于团队明白领导者是事实上的负责人，在这方面，领导者没有什么需要证明的。但在另一个方面，领导者需要证明一切：团队的每个成员都必须建立信任和信心，相信他们的领导者会有良好的判断力，保持冷静，并在最关键的时候做出正确的决定。领导者必须赢得这种尊重，证明自己的价值，通过行动证明他们会照顾团队，并为他们的长期利益和福祉着想。在这方面，领导者每天都要证明一切。
- A leader must be close with subordinates but not too close. The best leaders understand the motivations of their team members and know their people—their lives and their families. But a leader must never grow so close to subordinates that one member of the team becomes more important than another, or more important than the mission itself. Leaders must never get so close that the team forgets who is in charge.
- A leader must lead but also be ready to follow. Sometimes, another member of the team—perhaps a subordinate or direct report—might be in a better position to develop a plan, make a decision, or lead through a specific situation. Perhaps the junior person has greater expertise in a particular area or more experience. Perhaps he or she simply thought of a better way to accomplish the mission. Good leaders must welcome this, putting aside ego and personal agendas to ensure that the team has the greatest chance of accomplishing its strategic goals. A true leader is not intimidated when others step up and take charge. Leaders that lack confidence in themselves fear being outshined by someone else. If the team is successful, then recognition will come for those in charge, but a leader should not seek that recognition. A leader must be confident enough to follow someone else when the situation calls for it.
- 早起是我在海豹突击队中注意到的第一个例子，在这个例子中，纪律确实是优秀和卓越之间的区别。我在一些年长的、有经验的海豹队员身上看到了这一点。那些比其他人都早到岗的人被认为是最好的 "操作者"。这意味着他们有最好的野战工具，最整齐的装备，他们是最好的射手，而且他们是最受尊敬的。这一切都与纪律相联系。我所说的纪律，是指一种内在的自律，即个人意志的问题。与我共事过的最好的海豹队员无一例外地都是最有纪律的。他们早起。他们每天都锻炼身体。他们研究战术和技术
- On Monday morning, they both still insisted they could not work together and each demanded that the other be fired. Instead, and to their surprise, the commanding officer fired them both.”
- Take responsibility for leading everyone in your world, subordinates and superiors alike.
  - 承担起领导你世界中每个人的责任，包括下属和上级。
- Leadership doesn’t just flow down the chain of command, but up as well,” he said. “We have to own everything in our world. That’s what Extreme Ownership is all about.”
  Jocko在审视自己在链条上的挫折时得到了这种顿悟。"他说："领导力不仅仅是在指挥链上流动，也要向上流动。"我们必须拥有我们世界上的一切。这就是 "极端所有权 "的意义所在。
- As a leader employing Extreme Ownership, if your team isn’t doing what you need them to do, you first have to look at yourself. Rather than blame them for not seeing the strategic picture, you must figure out a way to better communicate it to them in terms that are simple, clear, and concise, so that they understand. This is what leading down the chain of command is all about.
  作为一个采用 "极端所有权 "的领导者，如果你的团队没有做你需要他们做的事情，你首先要反省自己。与其责怪他们没有看到战略图景，你必须想办法用简单、清晰、简洁的语言将其更好地传达给他们，让他们明白。这就是领导指挥系统的意义所在。
- As a leader, if you are down in the weeds planning the details with your guys,” said Jocko, “you will have the same perspective as them, which adds little value. But if you let them plan the details, it allows them to own their piece of the plan. And it allows you to stand back and see everything with a different perspective, which adds tremendous value. You can then see the plan from a greater distance, a higher altitude, and you will see more. As a result, you will catch mistakes and discover aspects of the plan that need to be tightened up, which enables you to look like a tactical genius, just because you have a broader view.”
- A leader’s checklist for planning should include the following:
  领导者的计划清单应包括以下内容：
  • Analyze the mission.
  - 分析任务。
  —Understand higher headquarters’ mission, Commander’s Intent, and endstate (the goal).
  -了解上级总部的任务、指挥官的意图和最终状态（目标）。
  —Identify and state your own Commander’s Intent and endstate for the specific mission.
  -确定并说明你自己的指挥官的意图和具体任务的最终状态。
  • Identify personnel, assets, resources, and time available.
  - 确定人员、资产、资源和可用时间。
  • Decentralize the planning process.
  - 分散规划过程。
  —Empower key leaders within the team to analyze possible courses of action.

  • Determine a specific course of action.
  - 确定一个具体的行动方案。
  —Lean toward selecting the simplest course of action.

  • Empower key leaders to develop the plan for the selected course of action.
  - 赋予主要领导人权力，为选定的行动方案制定计划。

- The mission must explain the overall purpose and desired result, or “end state,” of the operation. The frontline troops tasked with executing the mission must understand the deeper purpose behind the mission. While a simple statement, the Commander’s Intent is actually the most important part of the brief. When understood by everyone involved in the execution of the plan, it guides each decision and action on the ground.
  任务必须解释行动的总体目的和预期结果，或 "最终状态"。负责执行任务的前线部队必须了解任务背后更深层次的目的。虽然是简单的陈述，但指挥官的意图实际上是简报中最重要的部分。当参与执行计划的每个人都理解时，它就会指导地面上的每个决定和行动。
- 有时，军官走得太靠前，以至于他被吸进每个房间的间隙，这意味着他不断地进入房间，与目标交战。当这种情况发生时，他就会专注于眼前房间里发生的细枝末节，而失去了对团队其他成员发生的情况的认识，无法再提供有效的指挥和控制。还有一些时候，警官被困在火车的后面，负责清理工作。当这种情况发生时，他在后方太远，无法知道前面发生了什么，无法指挥他的突击队。我向许多军官建议，正确的参与程度--对他们来说正确的位置--是在中间的某个地方，一般是与他们的大部分部队在一起：不要太靠前，以至于他们被吸进每个房间的清理工作，但也不要太靠后，以至于他们不知道前面发生了什么。
- The fix is to empower frontline leaders through Decentralized Command and ensure they are running their teams to support the overall mission, without micromanagement from the top.

- leaders must constantly communicate and push information—what we call in the military “situational awareness”—to their subordinate leaders.
- 人类一般没有能力管理超过六到十个人，特别是当事情出现偏差和不可避免的突发事件发生时。不能指望一个高级领导去管理几十个人，更不用说几百个人。团队必须被分解成由四到五个操作员组成的可管理的元素，并有一个明确指定的领导者。
- 特别是对于组织的高层领导来说，"把自己从火线上拉下来"，退后一步，并保持战略视野。这对于帮助团队正确地确定优先次序至关重要。有了这样的视角，就更容易确定最优先的工作，并将所有的精力集中在其执行上。然后，高级领导必须帮助团队中的下属领导确定他们工作的优先次序。
- leaders must determine the highest priority task and execute. When overwhelmed, fall back upon this principle: Prioritize and Execute.
- But in the SEAL program, it is all about the Team. The sum is far greater than the parts.
