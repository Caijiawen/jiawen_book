## Highlights
- Generally, at-the-money options with the least amount of time remaining to expiration will experience the largest positive or negative theta values. The time value decay is slowest with long trading life remaining in the option.
- Gamma can be negative as well as positive. A long call or long put always has a positive gamma, and a short call or short put always has a negative gamma throughout the entire futures price range, with a single modal peak centering around at-the-money options. The deep in- or out-of-the-money wing options have the least change in delta and, therefore, the lowest gamma (Figure 3.1).
- Unfortunately, not only is there no a priori reason for past and future volatility to be the same, but also the record shows they usually are not, whatever period is used. Future volatility often changes over time, rendering historical volatility a poor and unreliable estimator of future volatility, whatever the period of historical volatility used.
