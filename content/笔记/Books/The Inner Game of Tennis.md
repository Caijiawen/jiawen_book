## Highlights
- I was beginning to learn what all good pros and students of tennis must learn: that images are better than words, showing better than telling, too much instruction worse than none, and that trying often produces negative results
- Imagine that instead of being parts of the same person, Self 1 (teller) and Self 2 (doer) are two separate persons
