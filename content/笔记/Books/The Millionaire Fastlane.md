## Highlights
- It's called “Get Rich Slow” and sounds something like this: Go to school, get good grades, graduate, get a good job, invest in the stock market, max-out your 401(k), cut up your credit cards, and clip coupons … then someday, when you are, oh, 65 years old, you will be rich.它被称为 "缓慢致富"，听起来像这样：上学，取得好成绩，毕业，找一份好工作，投资股市，把你的401(k)帐户填满，剪掉你的信用卡，剪掉优惠券......然后有一天，当你，哦，65岁的时候，你会变得富有。
  “Get Rich Slow” Is a Losing Game"缓慢致富 "是一个失败的游戏
- The Decision to Change改变的决定The harsh winter shot me into swift action. I decided to change. I decided to take control over something I thought was uncontrollable: my environment. I decided to relocate-to where, I didn't know, and at that moment, I didn't care.
  严酷的冬天让我迅速行动起来。我决定要改变。我决定控制我认为无法控制的东西：我的环境。我决定搬迁--搬迁到哪里，我不知道，而且在那一刻，我也不在乎。
  In an instant, I felt powerful. The velocity of that choice infused my miserable existence with hope and a small drip of happiness. My failures evaporated and I felt reborn. Suddenly a dead-end road converged with a dream. It just wasn't about the decision to move; it was about taking control and knowing that I had a choice.
  在一瞬间，我感到了力量。这一选择的速度为我悲惨的生活注入了希望和一丝幸福的气息。我的失败消失了，我感到重生了。突然间，一条死胡同与一个梦想交汇在一起。这不是关于搬家的决定；而是关于控制和知道我有选择权。
- 日子和周末变得模糊不清。当我的新朋友们在外面喝酒狂欢时，我却蜷缩在我的小公寓里反刍着代码。我不知道今天是星期四还是星期六，这并不重要。艰苦工作的荣耀在于此：它并不像工作；事实上，我很享受这种感觉。我没有工作；我有一种改变现状的激情。成千上万的人从我创造的东西中受益，这使我沉迷于这个过程。
- Process makes millionaires, and the events you see and hear are the results of that process. For our chef, the cooking is the process, while the meal is the event.
  过程造就了百万富翁，而你所看到和听到的事件是这个过程的结果。对我们的厨师来说，烹饪是过程，而吃饭是事件。
- Family (relationships)家庭（关系）
  Fitness (health)健身(健康)
  Freedom (choice)自由(选择)
  Within this wealth trinity is where you will find true wealth and, yes, happiness.
  在这个财富三位一体中，你将找到真正的财富，是的，幸福
- Remember, no man is a failure who has friends.” This reflects on the importance of having your life shared with friends, family, and loved ones. Wealth is making a difference. Wealth is community and impacting the lives of others. Wealth cannot be experienced alone in a vacuum. Believe me, the richest moments of my life occurred when I was surrounded by a family of friends and loved ones.

- Wealth, like health, isn't easy and is cut from the same fabric. Their processes are identical. They require discipline, sacrifice, persistence, commitment, and yes, delayed gratification. If you can't immunize yourself from the temptations of instant gratification, you'll be hard pressed to find success in either health or wealth. Both demand a lifestyle shift from short-term thinking (instant gratification) to long-term thinking (delayed gratification). This is the only defense to Lifestyle Servitude.

- 当我想到运气时，我想到了扑克牌手。错误的是，他们的手艺被理解为运气，而职业扑克玩家会肯定这不是运气，而是系统分析和玩家心理。世界上最好的扑克牌手是卓越的统计学家和人类行为的解释者。运气是否起了作用？当然，但作用不大，而玩家的能力则吸走了大多数人的银行资金。告诉一个伟大的扑克玩家 "你很幸运 "是对他的侮辱。同样，把运气归结为一个自制的百万富翁的成功也是在进行同样的侮辱。

- Sidewalkers loathe process, so their financial plan omits standard process (such as saving or budgeting) and relies on events. If you believe that luck is the sole source of wealth, you'll gravitate toward events of luck-a diligent quest to finding “the big hit.”

- Jobs suck. I mean that generically, not targeted toward a specific job. Whether you're an electrician or a store manager, you hold a job. Jobs suck because they're rooted in limited leverage and limited control. Sure, you can have great job (and a fun one too!) but in the scope of wealth, they limit both leverage and control-two things desperately needed if you want wealth. Here are six sucky reasons your financial plan shouldn't revolve around a job, the nucleus to the Slowlane.
  工作很糟糕。我的意思是泛指，不是针对某个特定的工作。无论你是一个电工还是一个商店经理，你都有一份工作。工作之所以糟糕，是因为它们植根于有限的杠杆和有限的控制。当然，你可以有很好的工作（也可以很有趣！），但在财富的范围内，它们限制了杠杆和控制--如果你想获得财富，这两点是迫切需要的。

Why not get paid with the simple passage of time and make time work for you instead of against you? Does that exist? It does, but it doesn't come from a Slowlane.
  无论你在做什么都能得到报酬，这不是很有意义吗？在你睡觉的时候，在你玩乐的时候，在你拉屎的时候，在你坐在海滩上的时候，都能得到报酬？为什么不通过简单的时间流逝来获得报酬，让时间为你工作而不是反对你？这存在吗？它存在，但它不是来自于 "慢车道"。

- A job is like sitting in the bed of a pickup truck. You're exposed to the harsh elements while the driver of the truck sits comfortably in the driver's seat. And if the ride gets rough? You get jacked around or worse, tossed overboard. There is no control sitting in the back of a pickup truck, and to have this “strategy” at the heart of your financial plan is asinine. If you don't control your income, you don't control your financial plan. If you don't control your financial plan, you don't control your freedom.
  一份工作就像坐在一辆皮卡的床上。你暴露在恶劣的环境中，而卡车司机则舒适地坐在驾驶座上。如果行驶过程中遇到困难呢？你就会被推来推去，或者更糟糕的是，被抛下海。坐在皮卡的后面是无法控制的，把这种 "战略 "作为你财务计划的核心是愚蠢的。如果你不能控制你的收入，你就不能控制你的财务计划。如果你不能控制你的财务计划，你就不能控制你的自由。

- Unless you live in a vacuum, you're already familiar with the Fastlane. When anyone experiences a get-rich-quick event via business, you're witnessing the Fastlane. Here are some Fastlane stories pulled from the headlines:
  除非你生活在真空中，否则你已经熟悉了 "快速通道"。当任何人通过商业活动经历快速致富的事件时，你就是在见证 "快速通道"。这里有一些从头条新闻中提取的 "快速通道 "故事：
  The inventor who creates a gadget and sells millions of them to 15 wholesale distributors.创造了一个小工具的发明家，向15个批发经销商销售了数百万个。
  The guy who builds a cell phone application and sells it 50,000 times.那个建立了一个手机应用程序并销售了5万次的人。
  The guy who formulates an energy bar to help him stave off hunger and later is offered $192 million for his company.这个人配制了一种能量棒以帮助他抵御饥饿，后来他的公司被报价1.92亿美元。

- 慢车族是一份工作：你的努力工作换来了雇主的现金。阿苏尔的挣扎类似于慢车族；为了致富，你被告知要变得更强壮（花钱，回到学校，在就业市场上赚更多钱），这样你才能举起更重的石头。快车道是关于建立一个更好的系统，一个更好的装置，一个更好的产品，或一个更好的 "东西"，以利用你的工作。在 "慢车道 "中，你是举重的源头，而在 "快车道 "中，你构建一个系统，为你做这件事。

- 破解 "快车道 "路线图的方法很简单，就是加入保管解密钥匙的团队。胜利的团队是生产者团队。重塑生活的重点是生产，而不是消费。当你把你的思维从多数人的思维（消费者）重塑为少数人的思维（生产者）时，你就有效地转换了团队和效忠对象。是的，首先成为一个生产者，其次才是一个消费者。

  Asset Value = (Net Profit) X (Industry Multiplier)
  资产价值=（净利润）X（行业乘数）。

- What is going to make you rich? An upper limit of exposure to 12,000 people per day? Or maximizing your hours worked in the day? That's 12,000 vs. 24. No contest. I get rich and the Slowlaner gets old.

- Contrary to this, Fastlaners buy and sell appreciating assets: businesses, brands, cash flows, notes, intellectual property, licenses, inventions, patents, and real estate. As it relates to the Fastlane wealth equation, the power of “Asset Value” lies in your ability to control the variable in a virtually limitless fashion.
  与此相反，"快车道 "者购买和出售升值的资产：企业、品牌、现金流、票据、知识产权、许可、发明、专利和房地产。由于它与 "快速通道 "财富方程式有关，"资产价值 "的力量在于你能够以几乎无限的方式控制变量。

- 例如，如果你坐在五金店外面，用你的热狗车卖热狗，你已经把你的速度限制住了，没有加速的杠杆。变量是有限的，因为你的触角被限制在一个小范围内。可以想象，你一天能卖出多少个热狗？40?100?你有没有可能回家后向你的妻子炫耀 "亲爱的!我今天卖了2万个热狗！"这是不可能的!同样，这与内在价值的24小时笼子没有什么不同。小数字对平庸有很强的引力。

- Asset Value = (Net Profit) X (Industry Multiplier)
  资产价值=（净利润）X（行业乘数）。
  Any time you have an asset that has sustainable profits, an industry multiplier governed by prevailing market conditions determines the valuation of that asset. Other people or companies will buy that asset based on the asset's net profit multiplied by the assessed multiple.
  任何时候，当你拥有一项具有可持续利润的资产时，受当时市场条件制约的行业乘数决定了该资产的估值。其他人或公司将根据该资产的净利润乘以评估倍数来购买该资产。
  For example, if you own a manufacturing company that nets $100,000 and the average multiple for your industry is 6, your asset value is worth $600,000. Industry multipliers are subject to intense negotiating as they rise and fall with the economy and within industry sectors.
  例如，如果你拥有一家净利润为10万美元的制造公司，而你所在行业的平均倍数为6，你的资产价值为60万美元。行业乘数随着经济的发展和行业部门内的兴衰，会受到激烈的谈判。

- Contrast the two wealth acceleration options for the Slowlaner and the Fastlaner. Your wealth acceleration options if you stay as an employed engineer:
  对比一下 "慢郎 "和 "快郎 "的两种财富加速选择。如果你继续作为一个受雇的工程师，你的财富加速选择：
  Raise your intrinsic value and HOPE the boss gives you a pay raise.提高你的内在价值，希望老板能给你加薪。
  HOPE the company doesn't lay you off, so you can continue receiving your income.希望公司不要解雇你，这样你就可以继续收到你的收入。
  Save 10% of your paycheck in a mutual fund and HOPE for an 8% return for the next 40 years.将工资的10%存入共同基金，并希望在未来40年内获得8%的回报。
  Your wealth acceleration options if you owned your own medical device company:
  如果你拥有自己的医疗设备公司，你的财富加速选择：
  Grow net income with an income potential only limited by the number of devices you can sell, that is, 16 million.增长净收入，其收入潜力只受限于你能销售的设备数量，即1600万台。
  Grow asset value at a factor of 1,700%.以1700%的系数增长资产价值。
  Liquidate asset value and turn paper money into real money.变现资产价值，把纸币变成真钱。
  Can you see now why some 30-year-olds are worth $50 million and some are worth $13,000? The Fastlane universe operates on gains of 1,700% and millions, while the Slowlane universe 8% and 40. One plan is about HOPE while the other is about CONTROL. Breaking news: 8% and 40 makes millionaires in 40 years: 1,700% and 16 million makes billionaires in four years.
  你现在能明白为什么有些30岁的人价值5000万美元，有些人价值13000美元吗？在 "快车道 "宇宙中，收益为1700%和数百万，而 "慢车道 "宇宙中，收益为8%和40。一个计划是关于希望，而另一个是关于控制。爆炸性新闻：8%和40在40年内成为百万富翁：1,700%和1,600万在4年内成为亿万富翁。

- Asset valuations of businesses, real estate, and other appreciable assets are nothing, but just that-valuations based on subjective analysis and market data. If the company you build from scratch has a paper valuation of $60 million and your bank account only has $10,000, are you really a millionaire? Not really. Illiquid, paper-millionaires can't buy Italian sports cars and palatial estates; money does. And to get the money, you have to increase profit and save it, or go for the big exit: liquidation.
  企业、房地产和其他可升值资产的资产评估什么都不是，只是--基于主观分析和市场数据的评估。如果你从零开始建立的公司的纸面估值为6000万美元，而你的银行账户只有1万美元，你真的是百万富翁吗？并非如此。流动性差的纸面百万富翁不能购买意大利跑车和宫殿式的庄园；金钱才是。为了得到这些钱，你必须增加利润并把它存起来，或者采取大的退出方式：清算

- Leases, royalty payments, and licensing are other forms of “rental systems” that can produce reoccurring monthly income. For example, when you own the rights to a music collection, corporations have to pay you a royalty to use the music. The work might have been recorded decades earlier, but it still generates royalties.
  租赁、版税支付和许可是其他形式的 "租赁系统"，可以产生每月的重复收入。例如，当你拥有一个音乐集的权利时，企业必须向你支付版税才能使用这些音乐。该作品可能是几十年前录制的，但它仍然能产生版税。

- My preferred system is computer and software systems, including the Internet. It's no shock that the Internet has paved the road to millions more than any other road out there. In fact, I heard a statistic that the Internet created more millionaires in the last five years than the previous five decades combined. What makes the Internet and computer systems so potent?
  我的首选系统是计算机和软件系统，包括互联网。互联网为数百万人铺设的道路比外面任何其他道路都要多，这并不令人震惊。事实上，我听到一个统计数字，互联网在过去五年中创造的百万富翁比前五十年的总和还要多。是什么让互联网和计算机系统如此强大？
  Computers are miraculous inventions and fertile seeds to money trees. They work 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and they don't bitch about working conditions. They don't bitch that you don't pay them enough. They don't bitch and moan about co-workers like Lazy Joan or Same-Shirt Bob.
  计算机是神奇的发明，是金钱树的肥沃种子。他们每天工作24小时，每周工作7天，他们不会对工作条件发牢骚。他们不会抱怨你给他们的工资不够。他们不会对懒惰的琼或同袍鲍勃这样的同事发牢骚和抱怨。

- 不，计算机不会迟到，它们不会要求加薪，它们也不在乎你刚买了一辆新的奔驰S级车。不，他们只是做他们被编程的事情，然后就完成了。互联网与房地产的不同之处在于它隐含着杠杆作用。当你拥有一个网站时，数百万人都能接触到你。当你在榆树街拥有一个三居室的房子时，只有少数人可以进入。这种双重性使互联网系统成为现有的最好的商业苗子之一。

- Another potent form of distribution is franchising and/or chaining. When a successful store concept is branded and systemized, it can be replicated and sold to other individuals. Savvy Fastlane entrepreneurs recognize that a successful local business with weak leverage can be made highly leveraged by franchises or chains. Does this path sound familiar? It should; this is what Starbucks did to become the biggest coffee chain in the world.
  另一种有力的分销形式是特许经营和/或连锁经营。当一个成功的商店概念被品牌化和系统化后，它可以被复制并出售给其他个人。精明的 "快车道 "企业家认识到，一个成功的、杠杆作用较弱的本地企业，可以通过特许经营或连锁经营来实现高杠杆作用。这条路听起来很熟悉吗？应该的；这就是星巴克成为世界上最大的咖啡连锁店的做法。

- The goal of this book is to change your perception about wealth and money. Believe that retirement at any age is possible. Believe that old age is not a prerequisite to wealth. Believe that a job is just as risky as a business. Believe that the stock market isn't a guaranteed path to riches. Believe that you can be retired just a few years from today.
  本书的目标是改变你对财富和金钱的看法。相信在任何年龄退休都是可能的。相信年老不是财富的先决条件。相信工作和生意一样有风险。相信股票市场并不是通往财富的保证。相信你可以在几年后就退休了。
  So how do you upload new beliefs and overwrite the old ones? Find the information, resources, and the people that align with the new beliefs. For myself, I pursued the stories of those who acquired wealth fast and soon learned that “Get Rich Quick” wasn't a myth. I never found that 19-year-old who got rich piling money into mutual funds. However, I did find 24-year-old millionaire inventors, business founders, authors, and Web site owners.
  那么，你如何上传新的信念并覆盖旧的信念？找到符合新信念的信息、资源和人。就我自己而言，我追寻那些快速获得财富的故事，并很快了解到 "快速致富 "并不是一个神话。我从来没有发现那个19岁的人把钱堆在共同基金里而致富。然而，我确实找到了24岁的百万富翁发明家、企业创始人、作家和网站所有者。

Join entrepreneur clubs, attend networking events, ally yourself with like-minders, get yourself around people who subscribe to a Fastlane, anything is-possible mindset, and decide who you want on your team of warriors. Read books and autobiographies of those who have the kind of success you want. Find a mentor. Join entrepreneur forums with a Fastlane mindset, like the Fastlane Forum!

- While I was building my company, my system, my surrogate, I was committed. I'd spend 12 hours a day for weeks perfecting and building my system. I'd forgo nights drinking with friends. I lived in a cramped studio apartment. I'd eat cheap pasta for lunch and dinner. I was ready to wash dishes to work my plan. While my friends were more concerned with bragging rights for having the fastest car on a racing videogame, I wanted financial freedom. I wanted a fast car in reality, not on a videogame. My friends were committed to being winners in a fantasy world, while I was committed to being a winner in the real world. Fastlane winners are forged at the Redline.
  当我在建立我的公司、我的系统、我的代理机构时，我很投入。我每天花12个小时，连续几周完善和建立我的系统。我放弃了与朋友喝酒的夜晚。我住在一个狭窄的单间公寓里。我的午餐和晚餐都吃廉价的意大利面。我已经准备好洗碗来实施我的计划。当我的朋友们更关心在赛车电子游戏中拥有最快的汽车的吹嘘权利时，我想要财务自由。我想在现实中拥有一辆快车，而不是在电子游戏中。我的朋友们致力于成为幻想世界的赢家，而我则致力于成为现实世界的赢家。快车道的赢家是在红线上锻造出来的。

- The brick walls are there for a reason. The brick walls are not there to keep us out; the brick walls are there to give us a chance to show how badly we want something. The brick walls are there to stop the people who don't want it badly enough. They are there to stop the other people!
  砖墙的存在是有原因的。砖墙的存在不是为了阻止我们；砖墙的存在是为了给我们一个机会来显示我们有多想要什么。砖墙的存在是为了阻止那些对它不够渴望的人。它们的存在是为了阻止其他的人!

- Now let's talk about intelligent risks. When I invest $100,000 in an Internet company, I'm engaging in an intelligent risk. When I sold my Internet company, I reinvested part of the proceeds back into the company. I still own a minor percentage and it is completely passive. Why did I invest $100,000 and expose myself to the risk? I assessed the acquiring company's probability of success to be high. Their goal was to take my small company and transform it into a $100 million company. If they succeed, my small $100,000 investment would then be worth $2 million. The downside? The company could fail and the liquidation value of my investment would lose about 50%. My downside is limited while the upside is substantial. This is an intelligent risk.

- In a magazine interview, billionaire RJ Kirk was asked about the benchmark to his success. He replied, “It is for others to say whether I am useful or not.” It isn't for you to decide whether you are useful. The marketplace makes that determination. People pay for their satisfaction; they don't pay to satisfy your need of “do what you love.” People pay for solutions, not for your enjoyment. People pay for solved problems. People don't give a dirty dog-ass about your love for whatever. If “do what you love” doesn't fill a need spectacularly, no one will pay for it!
  在一次杂志采访中，亿万富翁RJ-柯克被问及他成功的基准。他回答说："我是否有用是由别人说了算"。不是由你来决定你是否有用。市场会做出这个决定。人们为他们的满足感付费；他们不会为满足你 "做你喜欢的事 "的需求而付费。人们为解决方案付费，而不是为你的享受付费。人们为解决的问题付费。人们并不关心你对什么的热爱，也不关心你的狗屁。如果 "做你喜欢的事 "不能很好地满足你的需要，就不会有人为它付钱！

- Mike Rowe, host of the cable television show Dirty Jobs, profiled several owners of businesses who had less than lovable duties. From testing bovine manure to cleaning up pigeon goop, the owners were passionate. None of them “loved” what they did, but they had passionate “whys” and very deep bank accounts. Competition was sparse because everyone else was busy chasing “do what you love.” A formidable “why” is all you need to turn your daily activities into passionate motivation -the “get up in the morning” metamorphosis to bust open a Fastlane road. What are your WHYS, and are they strong enough to motivate you into process?
  有线电视节目《肮脏的工作》（Dirty Jobs）的主持人迈克-罗（Mike Rowe）介绍了几个职责不那么可爱的企业主。从测试牛粪到清理鸽子粪便，这些老板都很有激情。他们中没有人 "热爱 "自己的工作，但他们有热情的 "原因 "和非常深的银行账户。竞争是稀疏的，因为其他人都在忙着追逐 "做你喜欢的事"。一个强大的 "为什么 "是你所需要的，把你的日常活动变成热情的动力--"早上起床 "的蜕变，以打开一条快速通道。你的 "为什么 "是什么，它们是否足够强大，能激励你进入进程？

- While “everyone” was buying houses like crazy during the housing boom, I did the opposite. I sat on the sidelines and sold. When the frenzy is buying, you should be selling.

- The guy stuck on Main Street selling sandwiches has no scale and no magnitude. Is there anything this guy can do to turn his $40,000-per-year profit into $400,000? Nope. He's done before he even started. He didn't buy a franchise; he bought a job. He will never get rich until he wakes up and realizes that scale is not reached selling one-buck-margin sandwiches to 100 people a day.

- 如果你以有意迭代为目标建立一个小商店，你的目标不是一个商店，而是几百个，也许是几千个，通过连锁经营或特许经营的行为。有意的迭代者进入企业后，在许多成功的案例中曲解他的系统。一家小店开始时往往是违反了四条戒律，但通过迭代可以迅速转变为一个成熟的快速通道企业。快车道特许经营的前提是建立一个由系统流程定义的本地业务，然后在全国或全球范围内特许经营这一概念。迭代者的目标是复制和销售一个概念、一个品牌和一个系统，并将自己从运营中移除。虽然你的小熟食店可能不是特别快车道，但它可以通过特许经营或连锁复制的方式，通过II的过程变成快车道。

- Spectacular product features can't overcome poor service.壮观的产品功能不能克服糟糕的服务。
- This incongruity represents a one-way street: Fanatical customer service-service that SUCS-can help compensate for shortcomings, but fanatical features cannot compensate for poor customer service, or poor human interaction. The Venetian's floor could have been made of solid gold. It wouldn't have mattered. Nothing overcomes poor human experiences!

- The queen is the most powerful piece in chess and it is also in business. Marketing can convince people to buy mediocre products. Marketing can hide or disguise service flaws. Marketing can shadow incompetence, and marketing can keep convicted felons disparate from their product. The power of marketing is that a powerful ad campaign can move products, regardless of the cockroaches hiding underneath. Marketing is a game of perceptions, and whatever the perception is, that's the reality.
  皇后是国际象棋中最强大的棋子，它在商业中也是如此。营销可以说服人们购买平庸的产品。营销可以隐藏或掩饰服务缺陷。营销可以为无能蒙上阴影，营销可以让被定罪的重罪犯与他们的产品相距甚远。营销的力量在于，一个强大的广告活动可以推动产品的发展，而不管下面隐藏着多少蟑螂。营销是一场感知的游戏，无论感知是什么，这就是现实。
- The first human behavior you can count on is selfishness. People want what they want. People don't care about you, your business, your product or your dreams; they want to help themselves and their family. It's human nature. Therefore, our marketing messages must focus on benefits, not features. People need to be told exactly what's in it for them. How will your product or service help them? What's the benefit? In marketing speak, it's called the “What's In It For Me?” (WIIFM) principle.
  你可以指望的第一个人类行为是自私。人们想要他们想要的东西。人们并不关心你、你的企业、你的产品或你的梦想；他们想帮助自己和家人。这是人的本性。因此，我们的营销信息必须专注于利益，而不是功能。人们需要被准确地告诉他们有什么好处。你的产品或服务将如何帮助他们？有什么好处？在市场营销中，这被称为 "对我有什么好处？"（WIIFM）原则。
- Unique Selling Propositions (USPs) are the keys to your brand and differentiate your company from the rest.独特的销售主张（USP）是你的品牌的关键，使你的公司与其他公司区别开来。
