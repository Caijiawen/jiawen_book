## Highlights
- Very often the key factor is related to earnings. This is particularly true of the bank stocks. Chemical stocks, however, behave quite differently. In this industry, the key factor seems to be capacity. The ideal time to buy the chemical stocks is after a lot of capacity has left the industry and there’s a catalyst that you believe will trigger an increase in demand. Conversely, the ideal time to sell these stocks is when there are lots of announcements for new plants, not when the earnings turn down. The reason for this behavioral pattern is that expansion plans mean that earnings will go down in two to three years, and the stock market tends to anticipate such developments.很多时候，关键因素是与收益有关。这对银行股来说尤其如此。然而，化工股的表现则完全不同。在这个行业，关键因素似乎是产能。买入化工股的理想时间是在大量产能离开该行业之后，并且有一个你认为会引发需求增长的催化剂。相反，卖出这些股票的理想时间是有很多新工厂的公告时，而不是盈利转为下降时。这种行为模式的原因是，扩张计划意味着盈利将在两到三年内下降，而股票市场往往会预期到这种发展。
  Another discipline I learned that helped me determine whether a stock would go up or down is technical analysis. Drelles was very technically oriented, and I was probably more receptive to technical analysis than anyone else in the department. Even though Drelles was the boss, a lot of people thought he was a kook because of all the chart books he kept. However, I found that technical analysis could be very effective.我学到的另一门学科是技术分析，它帮助我确定一只股票是上涨还是下跌。德雷利斯非常注重技术，而我可能比部门里的其他人更容易接受技术分析。尽管德雷利斯是老板，但很多人认为他是个怪人，因为他保留了所有的图表书。然而，我发现技术分析可以非常有效。
