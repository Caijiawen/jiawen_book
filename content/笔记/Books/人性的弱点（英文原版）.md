## Highlights
- For‘the great aim of education, 'said Herbert Spencer, ‘is not knowledge but action.’And this is an action book.
- Criticism is futile because it puts a person on the defensive and usually makes him strive to justify himself.Criticism is dangerous, because it wounds a person's precious pride, hurts his sense of importance, and arouses resentment.
- When dealing with people, let us remember we are not dealing with creatures of logic.We are dealing with creatures of emotion, creatures bristling with prejudices and motivated by pride and vanity.
