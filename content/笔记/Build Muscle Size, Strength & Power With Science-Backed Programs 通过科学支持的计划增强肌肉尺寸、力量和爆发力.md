- Category: #articles
- Summary: The text discusses building muscle size, strength, and power through science-backed programs. It emphasizes the importance of proper training strategies to maximize strength and power gains. The programs focus on a combination of strength, hypertrophy, and rotational power to achieve optimal results.

## Highlights
- So with all that in mind, the last variable to talk about here is muscle power. And that differs from strength in that it is force multiplied by velocity. 
  考虑到所有这些，这里要讨论的最后一个变量是肌肉力量。这与力量不同，它是力乘以速度。

  So again, as I said a second ago, strength is effectively force production, power is force multiplied by velocity. Another way you could come up with this equation is work over time. 
  所以，正如我刚才所说，力量实际上是力量的产生，力量是力量乘以速度。得出这个方程的另一种方法是随着时间的推移而工作。

  So how much work can you complete over a certain amount of time? Power tends to be most important for sport application, though not always, but typically is the one you're more concerned with. 
  那么在一定时间内你能完成多少工作呢？对于运动应用来说，功率往往是最重要的，尽管并非总是如此，但通常是您更关心的。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j1z02xrc260mzwp4vqh46pwf))
- And so by enhancing velocity, I typically have the opportunity to enhance power. By enhancing force, I also have the opportunity to enhance power. And so almost all power programs will have a force component as well as a velocity component. 
  因此，通过提高速度，我通常有机会增强力量。通过增强力量，我也有机会增强力量。因此，几乎所有功率程序都将具有力分量和速度分量。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j1z04jn7mt3cnhnhcnhwmtc4))
- Strength needs to happen at a lower rep range so that you can get the intensity of the load high enough. 
  力量训练需要在较低的次数范围内进行，这样你才能获得足够高的负荷强度。

  Typically, what we're looking at there is, of course, what I've spoken of before, the 3 to 5 method, so 3 to 5 repetitions per set, but that could go a little bit higher. Really do remember, these are not hard cut-off lines. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j1z09f4rnctez13qyk3skpz8))
