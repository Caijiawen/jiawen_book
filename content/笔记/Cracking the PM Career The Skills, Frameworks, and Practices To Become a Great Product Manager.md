## Highlights
- The thing with getting good at a product is that, well, you're good at it. When using a product becomes familiar and easy (as it nearly always will be for its own PMs), it's easy to forget what it was like when the product was not familiar.
  Practice putting yourself into the mindset of a beginner. Walk through the full product flow from beginning to end
- Why users choose your product over an alternative
  • Which features are must-haves vs. nice-to-haves
  • How much time and attention users put into learning the product
  • The impact of "minor" usability issues
- Users are people. How do we get to know people? We talk to them!
  Aim to speak with at least five to ten people when you start working with a new product, and add another five to ten people during each project. If your product has different types of users (such as authors + readers or riders + drivers), talk to five to ten of each type.
- Instead of saying, "No, that's a bad solution," you can say, "Yes, I agree that's a problem worth solving." Even if your next sentence tells them it's not high on your list, they'll feel heard and be more willing to work with you in the future.
- Join employee resource groups, social groups, sports teams, etc. Invite your coworkers out for coffee or lunch. The more you feel like you have friends at the company and feel like you belong, the happier you will be in the role in the long run.
- Get as much exposure to users and customers as possible. Meet with them in-person or on video calls. If your company has them, join sales calls and user research sessions.
- Tell me about yourself.
  • What are you working on? What are some of your favorite past projects? What are you looking forward to working on?
- A second important goal of these meetings is to align on how you'll work together and how you'll split up the work.

- Relationships will be critical to your success as a PM. It's a lot easier to lead people through influence if you can show them that you understand their goals and care about them as people. This might be as simple as asking them about their personal interests and sharing some of yours - bonus if you have some in common! You might also want to share a bit about your past experience to quickly earn some ﻿ credibility.
- PMs often have two streams of work going at a time: one closer to discovery, and one closer to delivery. 2 This helps ensure that when the engineers finish their current work, there's no gap while the PM figures out the next thing to work on.
- The core product team at most modern tech companies is called the triad : Engineer (or Tech Lead), Designer, and Product Manager.
  • Engineers
  are responsible for the technical solution. They'll plan the data structures and algorithms that will make things fast, scalable, and maintainable. They'll write the code and tests.
  • Designers
  are responsible for the solution from the user experience perspective. What will it look like? What are the flows, screens, and buttons? They'll make mockups or prototypes of how the feature should work.
  • Product managers
  are responsible for selecting and defining which
  problems the team is going to solve, then ensuring the team solves them. They'll define what success looks like, and plan how to get there.
- A PM is the person on a product team who is responsible for choosing the right problems to go after, defining what success looks like, and guiding their team to achieve successful outcomes.
- However, to meet the market need, you will need to convince the engineering teams to build the product, requiring you to use influence rather than authority. Each product manager will draw on their own toolset—persuasiveness, supporting data, user studies, design principles, relationship building—to achieve this.
