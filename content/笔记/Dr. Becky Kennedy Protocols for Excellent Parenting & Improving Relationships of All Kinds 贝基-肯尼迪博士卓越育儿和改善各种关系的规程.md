## Highlights
- And I think that is really the definition of sturdy leadership. And that is the key thing that's present in a healthy relationship that at once I kind of know my values, what I want, what I need. I feel like I can be true to that. 
  我认为这才是坚固领导力的真正定义。这也是健康关系中的关键所在，我知道我的价值观、我想要什么、我需要什么。我觉得我可以忠实于我的价值观。

  And at the same time, I can kind of connect to someone else who probably has different wants and needs and maybe even slightly different values at the same time. 
  与此同时，我还能与其他人建立某种联系，他们可能有不同的愿望和需求，甚至价值观也可能略有不同。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqyjtjz5n34e7357eaxmdcgy))
- I care too much about my own needs and my own role as a leader in my home to do that. Same thing with in-laws. My mother-in-law doesn't respect my boundaries. She always shows up without calling. Now I don't want to get to this point. 
  我太在乎自己的需求和自己在家中的领导角色了，所以不会这么做。婆媳关系也是如此。我的婆婆不尊重我的底线。她总是不打电话就出现。现在我不想走到这一步。

  There's a lot of things in a relationship we can do before we get to this point but if that's really a boundary and I have a very kind of intrusive mother-in-law, 
  在我们的关系中，有很多事情我们可以在到达这一步之前做，但如果这真的是一个界限，而我有一个非常善于干涉的婆婆、

  a boundary would be saying, look, this is going to be awkward and I know you mean well but the next time you come unannounced, I will come to your car and say, oh, this time doesn't work for us. 
  一个边界会说：听着，这会很尴尬，我知道你是好意，但下次你不请自来时，我会到你的车旁，然后说：哦，这次对我们不合适。
  17:49
  You cannot come in and I will go back into my house and close the door. Like, now there's going to be lots of feelings around that, but you are now setting a true boundary. 
  你不能进来，我就会回到我的房子里，关上门。就像，现在会有很多感觉，但你现在设置了一个真正的界限。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqyjz8rme089j2ygn1759bvc))
