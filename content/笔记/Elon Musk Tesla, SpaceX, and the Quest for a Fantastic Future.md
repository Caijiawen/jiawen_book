## Highlights
- One thing that Musk holds in the highest regard is resolve, and he respects people who continue on after being told no. Dozens of other journalists had asked him to help with a book before, but I’d been the only annoying asshole who continued on after Musk’s initial rejection, and he seemed to like that.
- He became a one-man, ultra-risk-taking venture capital shop and doubled down on making super-complex physical goods in two of the most expensive places in the world, Los Angeles and Silicon Valley. Whenever possible, Musk’s companies would make things from scratch and try to rethink much that the aerospace, automotive, and solar industries had accepted as convention.
- 荣格提到的整合--软件、电子、先进材料和计算能力的和谐融合，似乎是马斯克的天赋。 稍微眯起眼睛，就会发现马斯克可能正在利用他的技能，为实现惊人的机器和科幻小说中的梦想的时代铺平道路。
