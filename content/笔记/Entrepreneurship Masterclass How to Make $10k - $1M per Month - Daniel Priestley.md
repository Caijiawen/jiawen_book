## Highlights
- Entrepreneurship and trading are very different. Trading is a zero-sum game, while entrepreneurship allows for value addition. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h97dfx0bswwx22ffcmh0t911))
- The digital age has created a different environment for entrepreneurship, with geographically dispersed teams and global customer bases. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h97dhersd3w321kdztc6g9ef))
- Entrepreneurship involves identifying what customers actually want and creating a complete solution to meet their needs. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h97djpe80ap3mxd91a6yyrkz))
- Entrepreneurship is driven by the desire for commercial success and involves taking risks and organizing resources beyond one's own control. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h97dm9ygj2jzvyea4rqgce5k))
- Specializing your own time on the most high-value tasks is important. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h97dn583z44vkq0b5g4grhrd))
- ‚Ä¢ A lifestyle business is small and focused on fun, freedom, and flexibility. It is ideal for those who want to travel and work, and prefer to keep the business small without debt or investors.
  ‚Ä¢ A performance business, on the other hand, is focused on growth and maximizing profits. It may involve taking on debt or seeking investors.
  ‚Ä¢ It is important to determine what kind of business you want to build and what your goals are before proceeding. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h97dvqxebhzx1s56rvwgkhx5))
- The concept for a business should ideally be linked to the individual's origin story. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h97emyxkz781knavensardrf))
- ‚Ä¢ Origin refers to one's background and personal story.
  ‚Ä¢ Vision is about what one would love to see happen in the future and what they want to do for the world.
  ‚Ä¢ Mission is the most high-value thing that one can do right now. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h97ewzz3624fg9mvhh2b3527))
- To achieve success in sales, one needs to learn how to generate leads, book appointments, make presentations, and close sales. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h97f8zqg7e4ymgr5p1zcjs7v))
- Approach entrepreneurship as a scientist conducting experiments, being willing to accept that some ideas may not work. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h97m87b66jwrae3pbb8v9d7d))
