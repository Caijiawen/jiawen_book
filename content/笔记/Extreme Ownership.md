## Highlights
- Despite all the failures of individuals, units, and leaders, and despite the myriad mistakes that had been made, there was only one person to blame for everything that had gone wrong on the operation: me. I hadn’t been with our sniper team when they engaged the Iraqi soldier. I hadn’t been controlling the rogue element of Iraqis that entered the compound. But that didn’t matter. As the SEAL task unit commander, the senior leader on the ground in charge of the mission, I was responsible for everything in Task Unit Bruiser. I had to take complete ownership of what went wrong. That is what a leader does—even if it means getting fired. If anyone was to be blamed and fired for what happened, let it be me.尽管有个人、单位和领导人的失败，尽管有无数的错误，但只有一个人要为行动中的一切错误负责：我。当我们的狙击小组与伊拉克士兵交战时，我没有和他们在一起。我没有控制进入大院的伊拉克人的流氓分子。但这并不重要。作为海豹突击队任务单位的指挥官，即在当地负责任务的高级领导人，我对 "布鲁斯 "任务单位的一切负责。我必须对出错的事情承担全部责任。这就是一个领导者所做的--即使这意味着被解雇。如果有人要为所发生的事情受到指责和解雇，那就应该是我。
- “You know whose fault this is? You know who gets all the blame for this?” The entire group sat there in silence, including the CO, the CMC, and the investigating officer. No doubt they were wondering whom I would hold responsible. Finally, I took a deep breath and said, “There is only one person to blame for this: me. I am the commander. I am responsible for the entire operation. As the senior man, I am responsible for every action that takes place on the battlefield. There is no one to blame but me. And I will tell you this right now: I will make sure that nothing like this ever happens to us again.”"你知道这是谁的错吗？你知道这一切是谁的错吗？"整个小组坐在那里沉默不语，包括指挥官、CMC和调查官。毫无疑问，他们在想我将让谁负责。最后，我深吸了一口气，说："这事只能怪一个人：我。我是指挥官。我对整个行动负责。作为高级人员，我对战场上发生的每一个行动负责。除了我，没有人可以指责。我现在就告诉你：我将确保像这样的事情不会再发生在我们身上。"

- Looking back, it is clear that, despite what happened, the full ownership I took of the situation actually increased the trust my commanding officer and master chief had in me. If I had tried to pass the blame on to others, I suspect I would have been fired—deservedly so. The SEALs in the troop, who did not expect me to take the blame, respected the fact that I had taken full responsibility for everything that had happened. They knew it was a dynamic situation caused by a multitude of factors, but I owned them all.
- The best-performing SEAL units had leaders who accepted responsibility for everything. Every mistake, every failure or shortfall—those leaders would own it. During the debrief after a training mission, those good SEAL leaders took ownership of failures, sought guidance on how to improve, and figured out a way to overcome challenges on the next iteration. The best leaders checked their egos, accepted blame, sought out constructive criticism, and took detailed notes for improvement. They exhibited Extreme Ownership, and as a result, their SEAL platoons and task units dominated.
- The best leaders don’t just take responsibility for their job. They take Extreme Ownership of everything that impacts their mission.

- Leaders should never be satisfied. They must always strive to improve, and they must build that mind-set into the team. They must face the facts through a realistic, brutally honest assessment of themselves and their team’s performance. Identifying weaknesses, good leaders seek to strengthen them and come up with a plan to overcome challenges.

- But I learned that good leaders don’t make excuses. Instead, they figure out a way to get it done and win.”

- Most important of all, he believed winning was possible. In a boat crew where winning seemed so far beyond reach, the belief that the team actually could improve and win was essential.”
    - Note: I need to believe my family members could improve and win.
- In order to convince and inspire others to follow and accomplish a mission, a leader must be a true believer in the mission. Even when others doubt and question the amount of risk, asking, “Is it worth it?” the leader must believe in the greater cause. If a leader does not believe, he or she will not take the risks required to overcome the inevitable challenges necessary to win. And they will not be able to convince others—especially the frontline troops who must execute the mission—to do so. Leaders must always operate with the understanding that they are part of something greater than themselves and their own personal interests. They must impart this understanding to their teams down to the tactical-level operators on the ground. Far more important than training or equipment, a resolute belief in the mission is critical for any team or organization to win and achieve big results.为了说服和激励他人追随并完成任务，领导者必须是任务的真正信仰者。即使其他人怀疑并质疑风险的大小，问道："这值得吗？"领导者必须相信更大的事业。如果一个领导者不相信，他或她就不会承担必要的风险，以克服获胜所需的不可避免的挑战。他们也将无法说服其他人--特别是必须执行任务的前线部队--这样做。领导者必须始终理解他们是比自己和自己的个人利益更伟大的事物的一部分。他们必须将这种认识传授给他们的团队，直至地面上的战术级操作人员。对任何团队或组织来说，对任务的坚定信念远比训练或装备更重要，它是赢得胜利和取得重大成果的关键。
- The leader must explain not just what to do, but why.
- “Ownership of everything!” I answered. “This isn’t his fault, it’s yours. You are in charge, so the fact that he didn’t follow procedure is your fault. And you have to believe that, because it’s true. When you talk to him, you need to start the conversation like this: ‘Our team made a mistake and it’s my fault. It’s my fault because I obviously wasn’t as clear as I should have been in explaining why we have these procedures in place and how not following them can cost the company hundreds of thousands of dollars. You are an extremely skilled and knowledgeable superintendent. You know more about this business than I ever will. It was up to me to make sure you know the parameters we have to work within and why some decisions have got to be run through me. Now, I need to fix this so it doesn’t happen again.’”"一切的所有权！"我回答。"这不是他的错，是你的错。你是负责人，所以他没有遵循程序的事实是你的错。而且你必须相信这一点，因为这是事实。当你和他谈话时，你需要这样开始谈话：'我们的团队犯了一个错误，这是我的错。这是我的错，因为我显然没有像我应该做的那样清楚地解释为什么我们有这些程序，以及不遵守这些程序会使公司损失几十万美元。你是一个非常熟练和知识渊博的监管人。你比我更了解这项业务。我有责任确保你知道我们必须在哪些参数范围内工作，以及为什么有些决定必须通过我。现在，我需要解决这个问题，这样它就不会再发生了"。
- When personal agendas become more important than the team and the overarching mission’s success, performance suffers and failure ensues.
- Implementing Extreme Ownership requires checking your ego and operating with a high degree of humility. Admitting mistakes, taking ownership, and developing a plan to overcome challenges are integral to any successful team. Ego can prevent a leader from conducting an honest, realistic assessment of his or her own performance and the performance of the team.
