- Category: #articles
- Summary: Dr. Matt Walker discusses how sleep plays a crucial role in improving learning, memory, and creativity. Sleep before learning sets the stage for optimal brain function, while sleep after learning helps solidify memories. Different stages of sleep are important for different types of memories.

## Highlights
- Q: How close to the learning episode does sleep need to arrive in order to maximize learning? 
  问：为了最大限度地提高学习效果，睡眠需要在多近的时间内开始？
  A: Sleep should occur within two and a half to three hours of learning to effectively strengthen and retain memories. 
  答：睡眠应在学习后的两个半小时到三个小时内进行，这样才能有效地加强和保持记忆。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxcadgtr9wqhersb5cyeptgz))
- In fact, there was a 40% deficit in the ability of the brain to make new memories without sleep. And we've used lots of different types. We've replicated that now. We've had visual information. We've had textbook-like information. 
  事实上，在没有睡眠的情况下，大脑产生新记忆的能力会下降 40%。我们用了很多不同的方法我们现在已经复制了这一点。我们有视觉信息我们有类似教科书的信息 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hwchnct13cwqyxcnj0p2fy9d))
- What was interesting is that when we tested the group that remained awake later that following day, their learning capacity had declined. But in the nap group, it seemed to restore the brain's capacity to learn. 
  有趣的是，当我们在第二天晚些时候对保持清醒的那一组进行测试时，他们的学习能力有所下降。但在午睡组，似乎恢复了大脑的学习能力。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hwchz7x7g82vrrk7hcpc6eap))
- that seemed to predict how restored and refreshed your learning ability was. And the best way that I've been thinking about this in terms of sleep, restoring or refreshing your encoding ability, and it's a crass analogy, 
  这似乎可以预测你的学习能力恢复和提神的程度。而我一直在思考的最好方法就是用睡眠来恢复或刷新你的编码能力，这是一个粗俗的比喻、

  and I don't mean to make a direct brain-to-computer analogy, but think of that hippocampus almost like a USB stick. It's very good during the day at going around and grabbing new files, but it has a limited storage capacity. 
  我并不想把大脑和电脑直接类比，但可以把海马体想象成一个 U 盘。它在白天能很好地四处走动，抓取新文件，但它的存储容量有限。
  16:18
  And what sleep was doing seemed to be shifting those memories from the USB stick of your hippocampus over up to the cortex, which you can think of almost like your hard drive, a much bigger storage capacity. 
  而睡眠的作用似乎是把这些记忆从海马体的U盘转移到大脑皮层，你可以把大脑皮层想象成你的硬盘，它的存储容量要大得多。
  16:31
  And by way of doing that, when you woke up after the nap or after a full night of sleep, you had this cleared out USB stick. So what could you do? You could go around and start acquiring all these new files again. 
  这样一来，当你睡完午觉或睡了一整夜醒来时，你的 U 盘就被清空了。那么你能做什么呢？你可以重新开始获取所有这些新文件。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hwcj84asswn9nx21b8hakkd4))
- Now, some people have argued that data, you know, in terms of its source and its reliability may not have necessarily been accurate but now we've got very consistent data. When you start school times later, Academic grades improve. 
  现在，有些人认为，从数据的来源和可靠性来看，这些数据不一定准确，但现在我们已经得到了非常一致的数据。入学时间越晚，学习成绩越好。
  19:34
  Psychological and psychiatric problems decrease. Truancy rates decrease. But something else happened in that story of later school start times that we didn't expect, which was that the life expectancy of students increased. 
  心理和精神问题减少。逃学率降低。但在推迟开学时间的过程中，还发生了一些我们意想不到的事情，那就是学生的预期寿命延长了。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hwcj9d65vam72vssdqaxpv6n))
