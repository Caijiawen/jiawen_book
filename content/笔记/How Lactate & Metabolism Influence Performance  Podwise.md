## Highlights
- Well, if we look at classic exercise physiology literature, there are three main predictors of endurance performance. And again, I really want you to think about marathon running, just as an easy example here. Your VO2 max. 
  好吧，如果我们看一下经典的运动生理学文献，就会发现耐力表现有三个主要预测因素。再说一次，我真的希望你能考虑一下马拉松跑步，这只是一个简单的例子。您的最大摄氧量

  Your efficiency and your lactate threshold. What I'm effectively saying is if you and I both have the same VO2 max and the same maximum running speed, but you are slightly more efficient than I am, 
  您的效率和乳酸阈值。我实际上想说的是，如果你和我都有相同的最大摄氧量和相同的最大跑步速度，但你的效率比我稍高一些，

  you will have more energy to run that race. So even though we can run as fast as each other, you'll be able to run at a higher percentage of your max speed before you get tired. 
  你会有更多的精力去参加那场比赛。因此，即使我们可以跑得一样快，您也可以在感到疲倦之前以最大速度的更高百分比跑步。

  This is classic Jack Daniels, not the whiskey, the famous running coach, has a ton of work in this area. In fact, a lot of people call him the greatest running coach of all time. 
  这是经典的杰克丹尼尔斯，而不是威士忌，著名的跑步教练在这方面有大量的工作。事实上，很多人称他为有史以来最伟大的跑步教练。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j3ct5w945rjzvsm8tgn6xv1r))
