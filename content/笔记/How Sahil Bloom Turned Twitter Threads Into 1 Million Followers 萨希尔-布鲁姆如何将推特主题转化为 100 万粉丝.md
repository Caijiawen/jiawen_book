- It was like, yes, I'm just going to I write the things that I love writing on a monthly basis, send them out to whoever cares and it builds over time. This slow, slow, steady build. 
  我当时想，是的，我就是要每月写我喜欢写的东西，把它们寄给关心的人，然后慢慢积累。这种缓慢、缓慢、稳定的积累。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxhb6q77kqefabzafmkvwpy9))
- If I had to do an investment thesis presentation, my first step personally was I would have to write a one-page memo to myself on why I wanted to do this investment, why I thought it made sense. 
  如果要做投资论文演讲，我个人的第一步是给自己写一份一页纸的备忘录，说明我为什么要做这项投资，为什么我认为它有意义。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxhb8e97h4n0mb833fnahxhh))
- It was why I loved Twitter when I first started was because You had to distill your writing into such little bite sized thoughts that if you weren't clear on your thinking around it, you couldn't do it. It just wasn't possible. 
  这也是我刚开始喜欢推特的原因，因为你必须把你的文章提炼成一小段一小段的想法，如果你的思路不清晰，你就做不到。这根本不可能。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxhb8t0ze1saq8vb65416ame))
- I've seen people say you know when in doubt just cut and like if you have any shred of doubt just cut the thing whatever I always found Twitter to be really helpful for that. 
  我看到有人说，你知道，当有疑问时就剪掉，就像如果你有任何一丝怀疑，就剪掉那个东西，不管怎样，我总觉得推特在这方面真的很有帮助。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxhbdy4mqrwpjtq4rjz61bhx))
- I mean, Tim's, you know, What's Our Problem, his new book, like it's a tome that is going to be out there forever. And could impact the way that people think about the world and how we solve our problems. 
  我的意思是，蒂姆的《我们的问题是什么》，他的新书，就像一本将永远流传的巨著。它可能会影响人们思考世界的方式 以及我们解决问题的方式。

  Most people won't ever read it because it's too big and dense, but the people that do might be the like, tastemakers of society that do start to shift because they're thinking about the problem differently. That's the positive. 
  大多数人都不会读这本书，因为它太大、太密，但读过这本书的人可能会成为社会的领军人物，他们会开始转变，因为他们会以不同的方式思考问题。这就是积极的一面。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxhc6pq0pvfp2pcmer11m24f))
- And when I'm writing from my mind, the writing tends to be bland and sterile. When I'm writing from my body and I have that lion-esque rush, I just want to roar. 
  当我用头脑写作时，文字往往平淡无奇。当我用身体写作时，我有狮子般的冲动，我只想咆哮。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxhcqp77emaf5fgwew8t33yn))
- Which is a I think probably a common thread among really successful people, but I really care about my currency of life if you will is The interesting people I feel like I can collect in my life and connect with each other and spend time around. 
  我想这可能是真正成功人士的一个共同点，但我真正关心的是我的生活货币，如果你愿意的话，那就是我觉得我可以在生活中收集到的有趣的人，并与他们相互联系，在他们身边度过时光。

  Because I feel more energy having an amazing conversation with someone I think is really smart one-on-one or being in a room where there's five people having this amazing conversation that I get to be a fly on the wall for. 
  因为与我认为非常聪明的人进行一对一的精彩对话，或者在一个有五个人的房间里进行精彩对话，我都会感觉精力充沛。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxhct9b1kcrjqny7jz7ckdcb))
- Every piece of writing is a call for the kind of person that you want to bring into your life. That's how I think about it. It's what kinds of people do I want to attract? What is the writing that I need to attract those people? 
  每一篇文章都是在呼唤你希望将什么样的人带入你的生活。我就是这么想的。我想吸引什么样的人？我需要怎样的写作来吸引这些人？

  And there's something about numbers on the internet that make people feel Like they're all the same because you're looking at views, you're looking at followers, you're looking at likes, but once you meet who your readers are in person you realize that they're just a reflection of what you're putting out there. 
  互联网上的一些数字让人觉得他们都是一样的，因为你看到的是浏览量、粉丝数和点赞数，但一旦你见到了你的读者本人，你就会意识到他们只是你所发布内容的反映。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxhd5h86r1gqax0dwswes7ty))
- And when I started writing on Twitter, which was May of 2020, May 12, 2020 was my first post, 500 followers out there at the time, which is funny to think today. No one had really started writing in thread format. 
  当我开始在推特上写作时，也就是 2020 年 5 月，2020 年 5 月 12 日是我发表的第一篇文章，当时有 500 名粉丝，今天想起来都觉得好笑。没有人真正开始以线程的形式写作。
  51:39
  It wasn't enabled even as a feature. You had to comment under your own post. There was no like ad tweet or create a thread where you could post it at once. 
  它甚至没有作为一项功能启用。你必须在自己的帖子下发表评论。没有 "喜欢广告推文 "或 "创建线程 "功能，您无法一次性发表评论。
  51:47
  I started doing that because I was interested in exploring ideas in a depth that went beyond at the time 140 characters, and it seemed like a good way to do that. 
  我之所以开始这样做，是因为我有兴趣深入探讨一些想法，而这些想法在当时超越了 140 个字符，这似乎是一种很好的方式。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxhdbms2cvhj6857jn27q7aw))
- You are much, much better off having 10,000 people that are truly connected with you because you've created really high value stuff over a year. Then by reaching 100,000 people by posting about TED Talks. 
  如果你能在一年内创造出真正有价值的东西，让 1 万人与你建立真正的联系，那么你的情况会好得多。然后，通过发布有关 TED 演讲的信息，与 10 万人建立联系。

  So Kevin Kelly's Thousand True Fans is like the Bible of this, right? It's really, really true. And yet we all still fall victim to this vanity metric mindset.
  54:47
  So what I've been encouraging anyone that's getting started now with Twitter or that had experienced the rapid growth and is now so frustrated is you just need to completely shift your mindset. 
  因此，我一直在鼓励那些刚刚开始使用 Twitter 的人，或者那些曾经经历过 Twitter 的快速发展而现在又非常沮丧的人，你只需要完全转变你的心态。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxhdcxt10777h63f4xcx5yvh))
- I also again come back to what we said at the very beginning that the constraint breeds creativity. 
  我还要再次回到我们一开始说过的话，即约束孕育创造力。
  1:03:04
  Once you're constrained and you know you have this window and you know you have to really push hard, all of a sudden things just start flowing. 
  一旦你受到限制，你知道你有这个窗口，你知道你必须真正努力，突然之间，事情就开始变得顺畅起来。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxhdez85qvydmwhpfzmv635j))
