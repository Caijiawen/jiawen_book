## Highlights
- Differences between a Mentor and a Consultant
  Key takeaways:
  - A mentor is someone who has already experienced and achieved what you want to achieve and can guide you with their knowledge and expertise.
  - A coach tends to ask well-formed questions and acts as a guide, rather than telling you what to do.
  - A business coach can help beginners in business learn and figure things out, similar to a tennis coach helping a beginner learn tennis.
  - Sometimes, people need to be told or shown what to do, even with well-formed questions, and that's where mentoring can come in.
  - It's important to have someone to motivate you in business, especially on days when you lack motivation.

  Speaker 1
  Firstly, yeah, there's a lot of common sort of misconceptions about the differences between business coach, what's a mentor, what's a consultant. So in my view, so a mentor typically has been there and done it, got the t-shirt, maybe they're 10 years ahead of where you want to be. For example, if you want to run a business, we'll go and find some of these runners, similar business with a mentor and they'll tell you what to do. A coach, in my view, tends to sort of ask well-formed questions. They're not necessarily there to tell you what to do, they're kind of more of a guide. And I suppose like my approach is a bit of a mixture between sort of business coaching and mentoring. So I ran the agency for 12 years, got that t-shirt. And sometimes as much as you can kind of lead a horse to water through well-formed questions, people don't often get it and sometimes they kind of need to just be told or shown what to do and away they go. Nice.
  Speaker 2
  So when you say business coach, like let's say someone is, like for example, if I want to learn tennis, I might be able to read a book, I might be able to watch some online videos, but like if I hired a tennis coach and I was like, look, I'm a complete beginner and I want to learn how to play tennis, they'd be able to help me figure it out.
  Speaker 1
  Is it the same thing for business? It's exactly the same thing for business, but there's a really important piece which you kind of missed out there as well, because there's going to be one day when you kind of a bit lethargic wake up in the morning and you don't really want to play tennis that much.
