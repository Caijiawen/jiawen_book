- Category: #articles
- Summary: This text discusses how our brains can change through neuroplasticity in response to experience and focus, with a focus on the dopamine reward system. It emphasizes the importance of relaxation, behavioral change, and top-down control in optimizing brain function and well-being. Overall, the text highlights the potential for individual growth and self-regulation through understanding and harnessing neurobiological processes.

## Highlights
- So throw out the idea of learning anything new, a new language, a skill, a thought pattern, it is not happening. But, What if I told you that that's simply not true? 
  因此，抛开学习任何新东西的想法，新语言、新技能、新思维模式，都是不可能实现的。但是，如果我告诉你这根本不是真的呢？

  What if I told you that you have the power to actually change your brain and reprogram your perception irrespective of age? Well, this is the life's work of Stanford neuroscientist, Dr. 
  如果我告诉你，无论年龄大小，你都有能力改变自己的大脑，重新规划自己的认知，你会怎么想？这就是斯坦福大学神经系统科学家，Dr. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hwpttgkqfds46ycr46y5nsnm))
- I moved into a studio apartment by myself. I quit partying completely. I didn't go to parties. I got Really serious about fitness. So I just started running and lifting weights and I studied. 
  我一个人搬进了单间公寓。我完全戒掉了派对。我不再参加派对。我开始认真健身我开始跑步、举重和学习 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hwpwfkjcex1sgrvw4g61q137))
- I loved books. So I would hide in the tower books section in the evenings and I would read everything about fitness, psychology, Anything I could, I've always devoured information. 
  我喜欢看书。因此，我晚上会躲在塔楼图书区，阅读一切有关健身、心理学的书籍，只要能读到的，我都会读，我一直都很喜欢阅读信息。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hwpwm9sv7abeajwcpykvw8hy))
- So for people that wanna change their brain, the power of focus is really the entry point and the ability to access deep rest and sleep. Because most people don't realize this, but neuroplasticity is triggered by intense focus. 
  因此，对于想要改变大脑的人来说，专注力是真正的切入点，也是获得深度休息和睡眠的能力。因为大多数人并没有意识到这一点，但神经可塑性是由高度集中引发的。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hwpxrtbywwa0t2j4shcgp3p9))
- A hard passage of reading, a hard set of math problems, a challenging physical workout. When you do that, these two systems have to work very hard and the adult brain doesn't really wanna change the algorithms it learned in childhood. 
  一段艰苦的阅读、一组艰苦的数学题、一次具有挑战性的体育锻炼。当你这样做时，这两个系统就必须非常努力地工作，而成人的大脑并不想改变它在童年时学到的算法。

  But if you do those two things, you have alertness and focus, the acetylcholine and the norepinephrine converge to mark those synapses for change. 
  但如果你做了这两件事，你有了警觉性和专注力，乙酰胆碱和去甲肾上腺素就会汇聚到这些突触上，为变化做标记。

  And so the way to think about neuroplasticity if one wants to change their brain is bring about the most intense concentration you can to something And then later bring about the least amount of concentration to that thing. 
  因此，如果一个人想要改变自己的大脑，那么思考神经可塑性的方法就是，让你的注意力最高度集中在某件事情上，然后再让你的注意力最不集中在那件事情上。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hwpzbmsqn5hdp89g1ya04fm2))
