## Highlights
- In today's show, we're going to be talking about sleep performance. Now, I like the term sleep performance to really indicate the difference between going from good sleep to great sleep. 
  在今天的节目中，我们将讨论睡眠表现。现在，我喜欢“睡眠表现”这个术语来真正表明从良好睡眠到优质睡眠之间的区别。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j2jpbwve47ed390qaa39n7mc))
- What I really want to spend most of our time here talking about is what really happens, does anything happen, when I go from six or seven hours of sleep to eight or nine? 
  我真正想花大部分时间在这里谈论的是，当我从六、七个小时的睡眠时间变成八、九个小时时，到底发生了什么，会发生什么吗？
  00:57
  How much of a competitive advantage am I getting over other high performers when I can go from that good to great sleep? 
  当我可以从良好的睡眠状态转变为优质的睡眠状态时，我比其他高绩效者有多少竞争优势？ ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j2jpepyrapyj18qrjgb1b6xm))
- But the solution is the fun part here. We were able to actually buy him a very cheap pillow, if you will. It kind of looks like a fanny pack that you wear in reverse and that kept him from sleeping on his back. 
  但解决方案是这里有趣的部分。如果你愿意的话，我们实际上可以给他买一个非常便宜的枕头。它看起来有点像一个腰包，你把它反着穿，这样就可以防止他仰着睡。
  05:36
  That reduced the amount of times he woke up throughout the night by about 80% in the very first night and it stayed that way ever since. So again, 
  这使得他在第一晚整夜醒来的次数减少了约 80%，并且从那以后一直保持这种状态。再说一次， ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j2jptfv5ne04aw0g1zngqmwq))
- Those will all be in the show notes available, but just want to read the title off of some of those right now. First one is Sleep and the Athlete, a narrative review and 2021 expert consensus recommendation. 
  这些都将在可用的演出笔记中，但现在只想阅读其中一些的标题。第一篇是《睡眠与运动员》，是一篇叙述性评论和 2021 年专家共识推荐。
  14:44
  This has got a large number of authors on this. If you're unfamiliar with like consensus statement means, it generally refers to a number, you know, typically five to 25 or more Scientists in a given area come together and say, 
  这引起了大量作者的关注。如果你不熟悉共识声明的含义，它通常指的是一个数字，你知道，通常是特定领域的 5 到 25 名或更多科学家聚集在一起说，
  14:58
  what are the things we all agree upon? And so they tend to be very strong in confidence because so many authors from different institutions worked on this. 
  我们都同意的事情是什么？因此，他们往往非常有信心，因为来自不同机构的许多作者都在研究这个问题。
  15:05
  So this paper I know came from Neil Walsh, who's a well-respected and extensively published scientist in the area, as well as Amy Bender, whom I spoke to directly about this. And so this is a great article to get you started on that. 
  据我所知，这篇论文来自尼尔·沃尔什（Neil Walsh）和艾米·本德（Amy Bender），他是该领域一位备受尊敬且发表广泛论文的科学家，我直接与她谈过此事。所以这是一篇很棒的文章，可以帮助您开始这方面的工作。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j2jq2a8mmzde7hnbds0q045h))
- And then the final one is Managing Travel Fatigue and Jet Lag in Athletes, a Review and Consensus Statement from 2021. So there are many, many, many, many other papers there, but I chose those three specifically. 
  最后一篇是《管理运动员的旅行疲劳和时差反应，2021 年回顾和共识声明》。所以还有很多很多其他论文，但我专门选择了这三篇。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j2jq1znv1477d7gayyp94647))
- So whether you're talking about free throw shooting percentage, reaction time, three point shooting percentage in the Stanford basketball team. 
  所以无论你谈论的是斯坦福篮球队的罚球命中率、反应时间、三分球命中率。
  23:01
  So you're talking about division one athletes that had 9% improvements in shooting accuracy over the course of a season by sleeping two additional hours per night. And so there's a lot to unpack there. 
  所以你说的是一级运动员，他们通过每晚多睡两个小时，在一个赛季中投篮准确度提高了 9%。因此，还有很多东西需要解开。
  23:13
  How do you get college kids to sleep two additional hours per night? And did you really say a 9% improvement in free throw and three-point shooting accuracy? Throughout the course of the season, yes, yes, yes, and plenty of things more. 
  如何让大学生每晚多睡两个小时？而且你真的说罚球和三分球命中率提高了9%吗？在整个赛季中，是的，是的，是的，还有更多的事情。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j2jqbvaqwa7bsddemfwga7y7))
- And this was done in tennis players and they found that it improved tennis serving accuracy by about 6% or so. Another one looked at a little bit less, so 45 minutes of extra sleep per night, but for a longer duration. 
  这是在网球运动员中进行的，他们发现这将网球发球准确率提高了约 6% 左右。另一项则看起来少了一些，即每晚多睡 45 分钟，但持续时间更长。
  33:47
  This was now three weeks. And they found a improvement in reaction time by 4%, as well as a reduction in cortisol by 19%. This was in rugby players. So a little bit different demand, a little bit different test, but still a similar story. 
  现在已经是三个星期了。他们发现反应时间缩短了 4%，皮质醇含量降低了 19%。这是橄榄球运动员的情况。所以需求有点不同，测试有点不同，但仍然是相似的故事。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j2jqntdj2mka3k7q56fb3zf5))
- We're talking people who are already sleeping a decent amount, 7 hours, and pushing them all the way up to close to 9 hours. 
  我们谈论的是那些已经睡了相当多时间（7 小时）的人，并将他们的睡眠时间一直推到接近 9 小时。
  34:26
  In this particular study, they found a 3% improvement in time trial performance, this is a 60 minute cycling test, in these highly trained endurance cyclists and athletes. 
  在这项特殊的研究中，他们发现这些训练有素的耐力自行车运动员和运动员的计时赛成绩提高了 3%，这是一项 60 分钟的自行车测试。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j2jqpkg2hgrxrasnkfbeygqj))
- He had to perform at that time. He was going to have to do the media obligations. There's just nothing we could do about it. The only real solution I would have had was to bank his sleep prior to going out there. 
  那个时候他就得表演。他将不得不履行媒体义务。我们对此无能为力。我唯一真正的解决办法就是在出去之前先储存他的睡眠。
  44:36
  He would not have performed at his best, no question. The research, especially from the military, is really clear here. When you go through, now we're talking really known sleep restriction, sleep deprivation, which is where we were at. 
  毫无疑问，他不会发挥出最佳状态。研究，尤其是来自军方的研究，在这里非常清楚。当你经历时，我们现在谈论的是真正已知的睡眠限制，睡眠剥夺，这就是我们所处的情况。
  44:50
  If you go through sleep extension prior to events like that, you can blunt or attenuate the drop in performance, which is to say, the performance drop will happen, but you can have it go down slower If you bank some sleep going into it. 
  如果你在类似的事件之前进行睡眠延长，你可以减缓或减弱性能的下降，也就是说，性能下降将会发生，但如果你存入一些睡眠，你可以让它下降得更慢。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j2jr24msqqyq8r40vfypdfa3))
- In fact, there's a really cool study on soccer players that asked them to do a very minimal, I think it was about 10 or 15 minutes before they went to sleep, to not use their phone. 
  事实上，有一项针对足球运动员的非常酷的研究，要求他们在睡觉前大约 10 到 15 分钟不使用手机。
  1:38:17
  They used an eye mask and then a couple of very, very standard non-invasive approaches to sleep. And what they found was the groups that did that were able to sleep almost an hour and a half more on the days following a game. 
  他们使用眼罩，然后采用一些非常非常标准的非侵入性睡眠方法。他们发现，这样做的小组在比赛结束后的几天里能够多睡近一个半小时。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j2js1sac9dx41a6aqdd1e0v1))
- And so if you are, you know, waking up at 6 a.m. during the weekdays and then you're sleeping in until 10 a.m. on the weekends, you're effectively creating a four-hour time shift Every single weekend. That's going to be highly problematic. 
  因此，如果您在工作日早上 6 点起床，然后在周末睡到上午 10 点，那么您实际上就在每个周末创造了四个小时的时移。这将是一个很大的问题。
  1:56:54
  It's almost no different than you getting on a plane and changing time zones every single weekend. And so really being consistent with your waking time is the best strategy. I like to anchor that. It's the easiest one to manipulate. 
  这与您每个周末乘坐飞机并更改时区几乎没有什么不同。因此，真正与你的起床时间保持一致才是最好的策略。我喜欢锚定它。这是最容易操纵的一种。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j2jsqewdns5a9f916bfymtsg))
- If you need more sleep outside of that, try to go to bed earlier the next night, or perhaps add in a nap like we've talked about earlier. If you're really gonna be extending your transition, 
  如果您除此之外还需要更多睡眠，请尝试第二天晚上早点睡觉，或者像我们之前讨论的那样添加小睡 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j2jsqjvy2ecvex62wsevgw03))
- And never forget in the famous words of Bill Bowerman, if you have a body, you're an athlete.
