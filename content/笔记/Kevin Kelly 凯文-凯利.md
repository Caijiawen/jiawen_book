When there are millions of books, millions of songs, millions of films, millions of applications, millions of everything requesting our attention — and most of it free — being found is valuable." 
  "无论价格高低，作品只有被人看到才有价值；没有被发现的杰作一文不值。当有数以百万计的书籍、数以百万计的歌曲、数以百万计的电影、数以百万计的应用程序、数以百万计的一切都要求我们关注--而且其中大部分都是免费的--被发现才是有价值的"。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hytmvn7b2nahxkv7ng7wreph))
