## Highlights
- ********“If you love it, make it your life. And right along with that, be tenacious. Learn that the most important thing about being knocked down is getting back up. And if you can put yourself in the spot where you say, ‘I don’t care how many times I get knocked down, I’m getting back up every single time and going after what I want,’ that’s the answer.” 
  "如果你热爱它，就把它当作你的生命。与此同时，还要坚韧不拔。学会被击倒后最重要的是重新站起来。如果你能把自己放在这样一个位置上：'我不在乎被打倒多少次，我每次都会爬起来，去追求我想要的东西'，这就是答案。********

- **“I understood, because of the way I’ve learned everything in my life that’s important to me, is you learn by apprenticeship, not from a book or going to school. At least I can’t.” 
  "我明白了，因为在我的人生中，对我很重要的一切东西，我都是通过学徒的方式学习的，而不是从书本或学校里学习。至少我做不到"。**
