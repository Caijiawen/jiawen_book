- 那么，当下一个亚里士多德出现时，也许如果他一生都带着这些机器--他或她的一生--并输入所有这些东西，那么也许有一天，在这个人死后，我们可以问这个机器，"嘿，亚里士多德会怎么说？这个怎么说？"也许我们不会得到正确的答案，但也许我们会。这对我来说真的很兴奋。这也是我在做的事情的原因之一。

- We started with nothing. So whenever you start with nothing, you can always shoot for the moon. You have nothing to lose. And the thing that happens is—when you sort of get something, it’s very easy to go into cover-your-ass mode, and then you become conservative and vote for Ronnie. So what we’re trying to do is to realize the very amazing time that we’re in and not go into that mode.

- It’s sort of like in 1844, the telegraph was invented, and it was an amazing breakthrough in communications. And you actually could send messages from New York to San Francisco in an afternoon. And some people talked about putting a telegraph on every desk in America to improve productivity.这有点像在1844年，电报被发明，它是通信领域的一个惊人的突破。你实际上可以在一个下午从纽约到旧金山发送信息。有些人说要在美国的每张桌子上放一台电报机，以提高生产力。
  But it wouldn’t have worked. It wouldn’t have worked. And the reason it wouldn’t have worked was because you would have had to learn this whole sequence of strange incantations—Morse code in this case, dots and dashes in this case—to use the telegraph. And it took about forty hours to learn how to use Morse code. And a majority of people would never have learned how to use Morse code.但它不会起作用。它不会起作用。它不可能成功的原因是，你必须学习这一连串奇怪的咒语--这里是摩尔斯电码，这里是点和破折号--才能使用电报。而学习如何使用摩尔斯电码需要大约40个小时。大多数人都不会学会如何使用摩尔斯电码。
  So fortunately, in the 1870s, Alexander Graham Bell filed the patents for the telephone—another radical breakthrough in communications that performed basically the same function, but people already knew how to use it. The neatest thing about it was that, in addition to allowing you to communicate with just words, it allowed you to sing. It allowed you to intone your words with meaning beyond the simple linguistics. 因此，幸运的是，在19世纪70年代，亚历山大-格雷厄姆-贝尔申请了电话的专利--这是通信领域的另一个重大突破，它的功能基本相同，但人们已经知道如何使用它。它最重要的一点是，除了允许你用语言交流外，它还允许你唱歌。它允许你用简单的语言学以外的意义来表达你的话。
  We’re in the same exact parallel situation today. Some people are saying we need to put an IBM PC on every desk in America to improve productivity. But it won’t work. The special incantations you have to learn this time are slash-qz’s and things like that. Most people are not going to learn slash-qz’s any more than they’re going to learn Morse code.我们今天处于完全相同的平行状态。有些人说，我们需要在美国的每张桌子上放一台IBM PC来提高生产力。但这是行不通的。这次你必须学习的特殊咒语是slash-qz之类的东西。大多数人不会像学习摩尔斯电码那样去学习斜线qz。
  And that’s what Macintosh is all about. It’s the first “telephone” of our industry. But the neatest thing about it to me is, the same as the telephone to the telegraph, Macintosh lets you sing. It lets you use special fonts. It lets you make drawings and pictures or incorporate other people’s drawings or pictures into your documents.而这正是Macintosh的意义所在。它是我们行业的第一个 "电话"。但对我来说，它最巧妙的地方是，与电话和电报一样，Macintosh让你唱歌。它让你使用特殊字体。它可以让你画画和图片，或者把别人的画或图片纳入你的文件中。
  Even in business, you’re seeing five-page memos get com­pressed down to a one-page memo because there’s a picture to express the key concept. And so we’re seeing less paper flying around and more quality of communication. 甚至在商业领域，你看到五页的备忘录被压缩到一页，因为有一张图片来表达关键概念。因此，我们看到飞来飞去的纸张越来越少，沟通的质量越来越高。
  And it’s more fun. There’s always been this myth that really neat, fun people at home all of [a] sudden get very dull and boring and serious when they come to work, and it’s simply not true. So if we can again inject that liberal­-arts spirit into this very serious realm of business, I think it would be a worthwhile contribution.而且它更有趣。一直有这样一个神话，即在家里非常整洁、有趣的人，到了工作时突然变得非常沉闷、无聊和严肃，而这根本不是真的。因此，如果我们能够再次将自由艺术精神注入到这个非常严肃的商业领域，我认为这将是一个值得的贡献。

- I personally, man, I want to build things. I’m thirty. I’m not ready to be an industry pundit. I got three offers to be a professor during this summer, and I told all of the universities that I thought I would be an awful professor. What I’m best at doing is finding a group of talented people and making things with them. I respect the direction that Apple is going in. But for me personally, you know, I want to make things. And if there’s no place for me to make things there, then I’ll do what I did twice before. I’ll make my own place. You know, I did it in the garage when Apple started, and I did it in the metaphorical garage when Mac started.

- Steve learned how to hone a company to its essence, even when it was painful. He shifted NeXT’s focus to selling software. The shift meant closing a factory and laying off more than two hundred of NeXT’s five hundred and thirty employees. Meanwhile, Pixar stripped away its advertising and hardware businesses and entered into an agreement with Disney, all to pursue what sometimes seemed an impossible dream: to make fully computer-animated feature films.史蒂夫学会了如何磨练一个公司的本质，即使是在痛苦的时候。他将NeXT的重点转移到销售软件上。这一转变意味着关闭一家工厂，裁掉NeXT公司530名员工中的200多人。与此同时，皮克斯剥离了它的广告和硬件业务，并与迪斯尼签订了协议，所有这些都是为了追求有时看起来不可能实现的梦想：制作完全由计算机动画组成的故事片。
  After nearly a decade of difficulty, the streamlined NeXT and Pixar both transformed into unlikely success stories. At the end of 1995, Pixar premiered Toy Story in the same month it held its initial public offering. A year later, Apple, in need of operating-system software, bought NeXT for $427 million. “If you really look closely,” Steve liked to say, “most overnight successes took a long time.”经过近十年的困难，精简后的NeXT和皮克斯都转变为不可能的成功故事。1995年底，皮克斯在举行首次公开募股的同一个月里首演了《玩具总动员》。一年后，需要操作系统软件的苹果公司以4.27亿美元收购了NeXT。"如果你真的仔细观察，"史蒂夫喜欢说，"大多数一夜之间的成功都花了很长时间。"

- Steve,史蒂夫、
  I am firmly on [Engineer 1]’s side on this one. He is taking your offer to help us very seriously, rounded up the best technical people and was ready to go when you introduced a brand new element into the discussion: money.在这个问题上，我坚定地站在[工程师1]的一边。他非常认真地对待你提出的帮助我们的建议，召集了最好的技术人员，并且在你把一个全新的元素引入讨论时已经准备好了：钱。
  You and I have talked many times about this subject; you never suggested or hinted at this being a commercial exchange. I took your offer to help us exactly as that: help, not an offer of a commercial relationship.你和我已经就这个问题谈了很多次；你从未建议或暗示这是一种商业交流。我认为你帮助我们的提议完全是：帮助，而不是商业关系的提议。
  You may remember, that from time to time I offered suggestions that pertained to your business. Examples range from porting NextStep to the 486 - - which was in our interest too - - to my presentation to your staff on repositioning NextStep beyond that. I am not suggesting that these are comparable in value to your expertise in graphics, but I gave what I had, put some thought into the problem I saw you were facing - - and it never entered my mind to charge for it. In my view, that’s what friendly companies (and friends) do for each other. In the long run, these things balance out.你可能记得，我不时地提出与你的业务有关的建议。这方面的例子包括将NextStep移植到486上--这也符合我们的利益--以及我向你们的员工介绍如何将NextStep重新定位。我并不是说这些在价值上可以与你在图形方面的专业知识相提并论，但我提供了我所拥有的，对我看到的你所面临的问题进行了一些思考------而且我从来没有想过要为此收费。在我看来，这就是友好公司（和朋友）为对方做的事情。从长远来看，这些事情是平衡的。
  I am sorry you don’t feel that way. We will be worse off as a result, and so will the industry.我很遗憾你没有这种感觉。我们会因此而变得更糟，行业也会如此。
  Regards,注意到、

- 苹果必须要有50%或100%的优势，因为当你购买有点脱离主流的东西时，你要承担风险，你希望为承担这种风险获得更大的回报。[这种差异化并没有完全消失，但在大多数情况下，它已经消失了。这就是苹果现在所处的困境。这就是为什么苹果公司的成本削减和其他事情不会是治疗方法。苹果的治疗方法是以创新的方式走出目前的困境。苹果公司还有很多优秀的人，在适当的领导下有能力做到这一点，而这正是一直以来所缺少的。

- And Apple was a very bottoms-up company when it came to a lot of its great ideas. And we hired truly great people and gave them the room to do great work. A lot of companies—I know it sounds crazy—but a lot of companies don’t do that. They hire people to tell them what to do. We hired people to tell us what to do. We figured we’re paying them all this money, their job is to figure out what to do and tell us. And that led to a very different corporate culture, and one that’s really much more collegial than hierarchical.

- Be a creative person. Creativity equals connecting previously unrelated experiences and insights that others don’t see.做一个有创造力的人。创造性等于把以前不相关的经验和别人看不到的见解联系起来。
  You have to have them to connect them. Creative people feel guilty that they are simply relaying what they “see.” How do you get a more diverse set of experiences? Not by traveling the same path as everyone else …你必须拥有它们来连接它们。有创造力的人感到内疚，他们只是在转述他们 "看到 "的东西。你如何获得更多样化的经验？不是通过与其他人走同样的路 ...

- So to be a creative person, you need to “feed” or “invest” in yourself by exploring uncharted paths that are outside the realm of your past experience. Seek out new dimensions of yourself—especially those that carry a romantic scent.

- Steve Jobs: You’d better have great people, or you won’t get your product to market as fast as possible. Or you might get a product to market really fast, but it will be really clunky and nobody will buy it. There are no shortcuts around quality, and quality starts with people. Maybe shortcuts exist, but I’m not smart enough to have ever found any.史蒂夫-乔布斯：你最好有伟大的人，否则你不会尽可能快地将你的产品推向市场。或者你可能真的很快将产品推向市场，但它将非常笨重，没有人会买它。在质量方面没有捷径可走，而质量始于人。也许存在捷径，但我还没有聪明到能找到任何捷径。
  I spend 20 percent of my time recruiting, even now. I spend a day a week helping people recruit. It’s one of the most important things you can do.我花了20%的时间在招聘上，即使是现在。我每周花一天时间来帮助人们招聘。这是你能做的最重要的事情之一。

- However, sometimes young people haven’t had the opportunity yet to be in a position of influence to create such results. So here you must evaluate potential. It’s certainly more difficult, but the primary attributes of potential are intelligence and the ability to learn quickly. Much of it is also drive and passion—hard work makes up for a lot. 然而，有时年轻人还没有机会在有影响力的位置上创造这种结果。所以在这里你必须评估潜力。这当然更难，但潜力的主要属性是智力和快速学习的能力。它的大部分也是动力和激情--努力工作可以弥补很多。

- Over time, my digging in during an interview gets more precise. For example, many times in an interview I will purposely upset someone: I’ll criticize their prior work. I’ll do my homework, find out what they worked on and say, “God, that really turned out to be a bomb. That really turned out to be a bozo product. Why did you work on that?” I shouldn’t say this in your book, but the worst thing that someone can do in an interview is to agree with me and knuckle under.随着时间的推移，我在面试中的挖掘也越来越精确。例如，在面试中，很多时候我会故意让某人不高兴：我会批评他们之前的工作。我会做我的功课，找出他们的工作，然后说："上帝，那真的变成了一个炸弹。那真的变成了一个愚蠢的产品。你为什么要做这个？"我不应该在你的书中这样说，但某人在采访中能做的最糟糕的事情就是同意我的观点并屈服于我。

- SJ: Well, I’m not sure I’d chalk that up to charisma. Part of the CEO’s job is to cajole and beg and plead and threaten at times—to do whatever is necessary to get people to see things in a bigger and more profound way than they have, and to do better work than they thought they could do.SJ：嗯，我不确定我会把这归结为魅力。首席执行官的部分工作是劝说、乞求、恳求和威胁--不惜一切代价让人们以比以往更大、更深刻的方式看待问题，并做得比他们认为的更好。
  When they do their best and you don’t think it’s enough, you tell them straight: “This isn’t good enough. I know you can do better. You need to do better. Now go do better.”当他们做到最好，而你认为这还不够时，你要直接告诉他们："这还不够好。我知道你可以做得更好。你需要做得更好。现在去做得更好。"

- As CEO of Apple and Pixar (he held both roles until Disney acquired Pixar in 2006), he saw his job as “number one, re­­­cruit; number two, set an overall direction; and number three, inspire and cajole and persuade.” He said, “You’re not grabbing the pencil out of the twenty-five-year-old’s hand to do it better than they are. If you’re smart, you’re hiring twenty-five-year-olds who are smarter than you.” He gave particular thought to his responsibility for the business aspects of a creative company. A “risk-taking creative environment on the product side,” he said, required a “fiscally conservative environment” on the business side. “Creative people are willing to take a leap in the air, but they need to know that the ground’s going to be there when they get back.”作为苹果和皮克斯的首席执行官（在2006年迪士尼收购皮克斯之前，他一直担任这两个职务），他认为自己的工作是 "第一，招聘；第二，设定一个总体方向；第三，激励、劝说和说服。"他说："你不是从二十五岁的人手里抢走铅笔，而是要比他们做得更好。如果你很聪明，你就会雇用比你更聪明的二十五岁的人。"他特别考虑了他对一个创意公司的商业方面的责任。他说，一个 "在产品方面敢于冒险的创意环境"，需要一个在商业方面 "财政上保守的环境"。"有创造力的人愿意在空中飞跃，但他们需要知道，当他们回来时，地面会在那里。

- At Apple, making sure the ground was still there meant streamlining, a skill Steve had mastered in the lean years at NeXT and Pixar. His second tenure at Apple was a study in focus. Soon after he returned, he slashed the company’s product offerings from seventeen to four. This upset some fans and led to thousands of job losses, but he was unwavering in his belief that it was necessary to save the company. “You’ve got to choose what you put your love into really carefully,” he said.在苹果公司，确保基础仍然存在意味着精简，这是史蒂夫在NeXT和皮克斯的枯燥岁月中掌握的一项技能。他在苹果公司的第二个任期是一项专注的研究。在他回来后不久，他就把公司的产品从17种削减到4种。这让一些粉丝不高兴，并导致数千人失业，但他坚定不移地认为这是拯救公司的必要之举。"他说："你必须非常谨慎地选择你所爱的东西。

- “Here’s to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They’re not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can’t do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do.”"为那些疯狂的人干杯。不合群的人。反叛者。麻烦制造者。方孔中的圆钉子。那些以不同方式看待事物的人。他们不喜欢规则。而且他们不尊重现状。你可以引用他们的话，不同意他们的观点，颂扬或诋毁他们。你唯一不能做的事就是忽视他们。因为他们改变了事情。他们推动了人类的进步。虽然有些人可能认为他们是疯狂的人，但我们看到的是天才。因为那些疯狂到认为自己能改变世界的人，才是真正改变世界的人。"

- LB: One of my favorite quotes from him is where he says that optimism is the essential ingredient for innovation.我最喜欢他的一句话，他说乐观主义是创新的基本要素。
  SJ: Well, it’s optimism and passion, because it’s really hard. And if you don’t really, really care about what you’re doing, you’re gonna give up if you’re a sane person—because it’s just super hard. I’m sure it was extremely hard for him at times. ✂︎SJ：嗯，是乐观和激情，因为这真的很难。如果你不是真的、真的关心你所做的事情，如果你是一个正常人，你就会放弃，因为这实在是太难了。我相信对他来说，有时是非常困难的。✂︎

- And so, what happened at Apple was that Apple’s goals used to be to make the best personal computers in the world. And then the second goal was to make a profit so we could keep on doing number one. Right?因此，在苹果公司发生的情况是，苹果公司的目标曾经是制造世界上最好的个人电脑。然后第二个目标是赚取利润，以便我们能够继续做第一。对吗？
  What happened was that, for a time, those got reversed: “We want to make a bunch of money, and so, OK, to do that, we’re going to have to make some good personal computers.” But it didn’t work. It never works. And so things start to fall apart.发生的情况是，有一段时间，这些人被颠覆了："我们想赚一堆钱，所以，好吧，为了做到这一点，我们将不得不制造一些好的个人电脑。"但这并不奏效。它从来没有工作过。于是，事情开始分崩离析。

- I didn’t see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me. The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life.我当时没有看到，但事实证明，被苹果公司解雇是发生在我身上最好的事情。成功的沉重感被重新成为一个初学者的轻松感所取代，对一切都不那么确定。它使我进入了我生命中最有创造力的时期之一。

- Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you’ll know when you find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on. So keep looking. Don’t settle.

- Remembering that I’ll be dead soon is the most important tool I’ve ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything—all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure—these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.记住我很快就会死，这是我遇到的最重要的工具，可以帮助我做出人生的重大选择。因为几乎所有的东西--所有的外部期望、所有的骄傲、所有对尴尬或失败的恐惧--这些东西在死亡面前都会消失，只留下真正重要的东西。记住你将会死去，是我所知道的避免认为你有东西要失去的陷阱的最好方法。你已经是赤裸裸的了。没有理由不跟随你的心。

- Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped by dogma—which is living with the results of other people’s thinking. Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most impor­tant, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.

- Stewart and his team put out several issues of The Whole Earth Catalog, and then, when it had run its course, they put out a final issue. It was the mid-1970s, and I was your age. On the back cover of their final issue was a photograph of an early-morning country road, the kind you might find yourself hitchhiking on if you were so adventurous. Beneath it were the words, “Stay hungry. Stay foolish.” It was their farewell message as they signed off. Stay hungry. Stay foolish. And I have always wished that for myself. And now, as you graduate to begin anew, I wish that for you.斯图尔特和他的团队推出了几期《整个地球目录》，然后，当它运行的过程中，他们推出了最后一期。那是20世纪70年代中期，我和你一样大。最后一期的封底是一张清晨乡间小路的照片，如果你是个冒险家，你可能会发现自己在上面搭便车。照片下面写着："保持饥饿。保持愚昧"。这是他们签字时的告别语。保持饥饿。保持愚昧。我一直希望自己也能如此。而现在，在你们毕业重新开始的时候，我也希望你们如此。
  Stay hungry. Stay foolish.保持饥饿。保持愚昧。
