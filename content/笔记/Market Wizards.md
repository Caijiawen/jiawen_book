## Highlights
- It was really great, because I had Ed to learn from, and he was already a very successful trader. He was basically a trend follower, who utilized classic trading principles. He taught me how to cut my losses, as well as the importance of riding winners
- Ed Seykota. He is a genius and a great trader who has been phenomenally successful. When I first met Ed he had recently graduated from MIT and had developed one of the first computer programs for testing and trading technical systems
- 在那些日子里，我在加利福尼亚有一个优势，因为当我的纽约同事在睡觉时，我在香港进行交易。我记得当我从电视新闻中听到入侵阿富汗的消息时。我打电话给香港，看看是否有人知道这件事，似乎没有人知道；价格没有变化。在所有人都知道发生了什么之前，我就已经买了20万盎司的黄金。
