### Michael Marcus: Blighting Never Strikes Twice

> üìå I learned that if you shoot for what you want, you stand a much better chance of getting it because you care much more.

> üìå Ed provided an excellent role model. For example, one time, he was short silver and the market just kept eking down, a half penny a day, a penny a day. Everyone else seemed to be bullish, talking about why silver had to go up because it was so cheap, but Ed just stayed short. Ed said, ‚ÄúThe trend is down, and I‚Äôm going to stay short until the trend changes.‚Äù I learned patience from him in the way he followed the trend

> üìå Ed Seykota never would get out of anything unless the trend changed. So Ed was in, while I was out, and I watched in agony as soybeans went limit-up for twelve consecutive days. I was real competitive, and every day I would come into the office knowing he was in and I was out. I dreaded going to work, because I knew soybeans would be bid limit again and I couldn‚Äôt get in.

#### Market Wizards_2

> üìå The first thing I would say is always bet less than 5 percent of your money on any one idea. That way you can be wrong more than twenty times; it will take you a long time to lose your money. 
> ‚è± 2023-09-29 17:29:06 ^CB-1ILCwvCxwA1l6hJ6gWEED1PM-16-36378-36569

> üìå The next thing I would advise is to always use stops. I mean actually put them in, because that commits you to get out at a certain point 
> ‚è± 2023-09-29 17:29:20 ^CB-1ILCwvCxwA1l6hJ6gWEED1PM-16-37318-37455

> üìå Perhaps the most important rule is to hold on to your winners and cut your losers. Both are equally important. If you don‚Äôt stay with your winners, you are not going to be able to pay for the losers.

> üìå Marcus stresses the importance of committing to an exit point on every trade. He feels that protective stops are very important because they force this commitment on the trader. He also recommends liquidating positions to achieve mental clarity when one is losing money and is confused regarding market decisions

> üìå Marcus also emphasizes the necessity of following your own mind as a trader. He suggests that following the advice of others, even when they are good traders, often leads to problems as it combines the worst elements of both traders.

### Bruce Kovner: The World Trader

> üìå when something happens to disturb my emotional equilibrium and my sense of what the world is like, I close out all positions related to that event. 
> ‚è± 2023-09-29 21:35:40 ^CB-1ILCwvCxwA1l6hJ6gWEED1PM-18-53967-54232

> üìå You have to be willing to make mistakes regularly; there is nothing wrong with it. Michael taught me about making your best judgment, being wrong, making your next best judgment, being wrong, making your third best judgment, and then doubling your money. 
> ‚è± 2023-09-29 21:38:53 ^CB-1ILCwvCxwA1l6hJ6gWEED1PM-18-63621-63994

> üìå For me, technical analysis is like a thermometer. Fundamentalists who say they are not going to pay any attention to the charts are like a doctor who says he‚Äôs not going to take a patient‚Äôs temperature. But, of course, that would be sheer folly. If you are a responsible participant in the market, you always want to know where the market is‚Äîwhether it is hot and excitable, or cold and stagnant. You want to know everything you can about the market to give you an edge. 
> ‚è± 2023-09-29 21:48:35 ^CB-1ILCwvCxwA1l6hJ6gWEED1PM-18-88848-89436

> üìå Whenever I enter a position, I have a predetermined stop. That is the only way I can sleep. I know where I‚Äôm getting out before I get in. The position size on a trade is determined by the stop, and the stop is determined on a technical basis. For example, if the market is in the midst of a trading range, it makes no sense to put your stop within that range, since you are likely to be taken out. I always place my stop beyond some technical barrier.

#### Market Wizards_2

> üìå The moral is: Place your stops at a point that, if reached, will reasonably indicate that the trade is wrong, not at a point determined primarily by the maximum dollar amount you are willing to lose per contract. If the meaningful stop point implies an uncomfortably large loss per contract, trade a smaller number of contracts.

### Richard Dennis: A Legend Retires

> üìå There was one in the first year. I had just quit graduate school to trade. One day, I made a particularly bad trade and lost about $300. Since I only had about $3,000, that was a very big loss and it was destabilizing. I then compounded the error by reversing my original position and losing again. To top things off, I then reversed back to my original position and lost a third time. By the end of the day, I had lost $1,000, or one-third of my entire capitalization. 
> ‚è± 2023-10-07 23:39:21 ^CB-1ILCwvCxwA1l6hJ6gWEED1PM-21-52381-52968

> üìå When we have had bad trading periods, it is really not one market that does it. In those situations, almost all the markets are going sideways and making lots of false breakouts. If one of the markets is decent, that is usually enough to avoid a bad situation.ÂΩìÊàë‰ª¨ÊúâÁ≥üÁ≥ïÁöÑ‰∫§ÊòìÊúüÊó∂ÔºåÁúüÁöÑ‰∏çÊòØ‰∏Ä‰∏™Â∏ÇÂú∫Âú®ÂÅöËøô‰ª∂‰∫ã„ÄÇÂú®Ëøô‰∫õÊÉÖÂÜµ‰∏ãÔºåÂá†‰πéÊâÄÊúâÁöÑÂ∏ÇÂú∫ÈÉΩÂú®Ê®™Ë°åÔºåÂπ∂ÂÅöÂá∫ÂæàÂ§öËôöÂÅáÁöÑÁ™ÅÁ†¥„ÄÇÂ¶ÇÊûúÂÖ∂‰∏≠‰∏Ä‰∏™Â∏ÇÂú∫ÊòØ‰ΩìÈù¢ÁöÑÔºåËøôÈÄöÂ∏∏Ë∂≥‰ª•ÈÅøÂÖç‰∏Ä‰∏™Á≥üÁ≥ïÁöÑÊÉÖÂÜµ„ÄÇ
