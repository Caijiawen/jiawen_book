## Highlights
- Q: When and how much should I charge somebody for my product or service? 
  问：我的产品或服务应该何时收费，收费多少？
  A: I think most people undercharge because they believe that I think it's mostly founders. There's an insecurity of launching your product and then having the market respond to it that makes you afraid to ask for the money that it's worth. I actually usually advise that I do think you want to monetize very early. For me, I think you learn so much from people buying your product and then using it. 
  答：我认为大多数人收费过低是因为他们相信，我认为这主要是创始人的原因。推出自己的产品，然后让市场对其做出反应，这种不安全感会让你不敢要价。实际上，我通常会建议你尽早实现货币化。对我来说，我认为你能从人们购买你的产品并使用它的过程中学到很多东西。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hx9cvtx9fzqceszcetzmqefd))
