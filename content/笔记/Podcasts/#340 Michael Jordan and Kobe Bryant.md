## Highlights
- Embrace Autonomy and Relentlessness for Success
  Summary:
  Success demands independence and a relentless pursuit of one's goals.
  Tim Grover emphasizes the importance of trusting one's instincts and not relying on others to dictate actions. He highlights the mentality of successful individuals who chart their own paths.
  The story of Mozart reinforces this point, emphasizing the value of self-reliance and determination.
  The term 'relentless' signifies unwavering commitment and determination to achieve desired outcomes.
  While icons like Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant embody relentlessness, even figures like Jeff Bezos epitomize this quality. Success stems from individual drive, inner guidance, and an unyielding pursuit of goals, rather than seeking external direction or a prescribed formula for success.

  And the most common criticism he got was it doesn't, the book doesn't tell you what to do. And this is what Tim Grover said about that. That is 100% accurate. Why would anyone want to be told what to do? The whole point of this book is that in order to be successful, to truly have what you want in your life, you must stop waiting to be told what to do and how to do it. I can't give you a 10-step process or a checklist. What I am giving you is insight into the mentality of those who have found unparalleled success by trusting their own instincts. And so there's a very old story that's very reminiscent of what he's talking about. Obviously he's talking about Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant, some other people he trained as well. But there was a story about back in Mozart's day and a man, a young man was 21 years old and he asked Mozart. He's like, well, how do you write a symphony? And Mozart replied that you're too young to write a symphony. And that young man said, but you were writing symphonies when you were 10 and I am 21. And Mozart's response was very much the point that Tim Grover is trying to teach us right in the first chapter. He's like, yeah, but I didn't go around asking people how to do it. And so he talks about why he titled the book relentless. And he says, the word relentless is used to describe the most intense competitors and achievers imaginable, those who stop at nothing to get the end result. And what popped to mind when I read that is, of course, Kobe and Michael are relentless. But when I hear the word relentless, the first person that comes to my mind is not Kobe or Michael Jordan. It's Jeff Bezos. ([TimeÂ 0:02:40](https://share.snipd.com/snip/81f708ee-b912-4619-a1b9-e75ea9df1ae9))
