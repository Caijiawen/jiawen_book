  So why does time blocking work so well? And again, my claim with time blocking is it's 2x more efficient. You give me an amount of work. How much time does it take you to get that work done without time blocking? Cut that in half if you're using time blocking. So why does it work? Well, there's three things that are going on here. One, you make it better use of your available time in a given day, right? Because you actually see the whole picture. I have a meeting here, a meeting there. Oh, there's this block of time in the morning, maybe it's more valuable than I would have realized if I wasn't time blocking. Let me get started here. Oh, I have these slivers of time between these meetings. Let me consolidate my task. That's the best usage of it. So when you're considering your whole schedule for the day as a whole and you're holistically saying of the different things are going to try to get done today, what's the right way to assign this work to the various free time? You just make better use of that free time. Then the alternative of just saying, I don't know, I'm going through my day. I have a to-do list. I have my email. I'm just sort of thinking, what should I work on next? You're going to, with that alternative default approach, you're going to make much less efficient use of the time that's available. The second reason why time blocking works so well is that it helps you focus. When you know, okay, at this moment, I am in a block to be working on this. This block lasts one hour. That clarity allows you to focus. ([Time 0:21:11](https://share.snipd.com/snip/d8dd706c-dd19-45be-823e-76e24a2e123a))
