  Speaker 1
  Right, let's get cracking. We've got lots of questions to get through once again, a huge thank you to all of you for sending them in. We've had hundreds and hundreds, so it's difficult to get down to a few, but we'll do our best to answer as many as we can. Let's start with Oliver Tudge. How much thought did you give to your celebrations and what is the worst celebration you have seen?
  Speaker 2
  Honestly, let me go first because Oliver's serens celebration is the worst I've ever seen.
  Speaker 3
  Well, you've seen it 422 fucking times. They're shocking. I hate no seriously, Alan.
  Speaker 2
  Seriously. So, like, all them goals, you can come up with something. All you did is basically put your hand up like that, and then there was a one where there was two hands. I mean, it was so basic. What's up with you, Miker Richards.
  Speaker 3
  It's unique. It's very different. Different. It was there. It was everyone, just the one arm. I mean, I couldn't do any somersaults that have been out injured for six months and all that rubbish. Yeah. Just running away the arm in the some collective. ([TimeÂ 0:02:10](https://share.snipd.com/snip/6f5a36c4-6872-4c33-85fa-6a8629b0f292))
