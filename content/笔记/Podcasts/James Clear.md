  Habits matter, not because they can get you better results, which they can do, but also because they can change your beliefs about who you are. Yeah.
  Speaker 1
  I don't think this is unique necessarily to habits. Like I'm not saying other experiences in life don't matter or that, you know, a one off event or something doesn't make a difference. Those things do matter. It's just that over time, your habits are the experiences that get repeated. And so the weight of the story starts to shift in favor of that just because of the frequency of them and everything else starts to be like, Oh, that just happened one time or this was a blip on the radar or whatever. And so I think they are unique in their long term ability to shape identity because day after day, week after week, you're getting these little bits of proof that, Hey, this is part of my story.
  Speaker 2
  One of the most sort of viral aspects of your book is about how important it is to focus on building a system rather than trying to achieve a specific goal or an outcome. And you state that you don't rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems. I'm wondering if we can just deconstruct that a little bit for my listeners. What do you mean by a system?
  Speaker 1
  So your goal is your desired outcome. What is your system? Your system is the collection of habits that you follow. And if there is ever a gap between your goal and your system, if there's ever a gap between your desired outcome and your daily habits, your daily habits will always win. You know, almost by definition, your current habits are perfectly designed to deliver your current results. So whatever system you've been running for the last six months or year or two years, it's carried you almost inevitably to the outcomes that you have right now. In many ways, our results in life are kind of like a lagging measure or at least to a large degree, they're a lagging measure of the habits that preceded them. So your bank account is a lagging measure of your financial habits. Your knowledge is a lagging measure of your reading and learning habits, even like silly stuff, like the amount of clutter in your living room is a lagging measure of your cleaning habits. We also badly want better results in life. But the results are not actually the thing that needs to change. You know, it's like fix the inputs and the outputs will fix themselves. And this doesn't mean that, you know, there are many things in life that influence outcomes, you know, I'm not saying habits are the only thing that matters. You've got luck and randomness, you have misfortune, you know, all sorts of things can befall you. But by definition, luck and randomness are not under your control. And your habits are. And the only reasonable, rational approach in life is to focus on the elements of the situation that are within your control. So I think for all of those reasons, I encourage people to focus on building a system rather than worrying too much about a goal. And I totally get why this is hard. Some of it, I think is just a byproduct of the way that both major media and social media works. You're only going to hear about something once it's a result. You know, you're never going to see a story that's like, lady eats chicken and salad for lunch today. You know, it's only a story once lady loses 100 pounds, or you're never going to see people, you know, talking about on the news, like James Clear writes 500 words today. It's only a story once it's like atomic habits is the best seller. The outcomes of success are highly visible and widely discussed. And the process of success is often invisible and hidden from view. And I think that leads us to overvaluing results and maybe undervaluing the process of the system. And so all I'm trying to get out with this is a little bit of an encouragement to say, Hey, goals are great and success is awesome. But let's maybe put that on the shelf for a minute and spend most of our days focused on what collection of habits am I following? What system am I running? And kind of adjust the gears of that machine a little bit and start running a better system. And that'll carry me to a different destination naturally.
