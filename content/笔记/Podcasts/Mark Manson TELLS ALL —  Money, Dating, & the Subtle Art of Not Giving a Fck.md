  Well, I'll start with the content side. It's less interesting, but I'll start with it because it's quicker, which is just like most of my content was bad at first. And I think that's true of anybody. And you just get those reps and, you know, I, I you back in the day, back when blogs were still a thing. I used to get asked all the time, like, how do I start a blog? How do I grow a blog? Make make a living as a blogger. My answer was always the same, which is like, write a hundred blog posts, come ask me again. Right.

  And have you seen by the Mr. Beast has like almost the exact verbatim answer? Yes. And I love it because yeah, it's the exact same thing I used to tell people. And it's a combination of like, it's actually the right advice because you need a bunch of reps and you need to suck for a little bit and get that. Just try to make each of the next video better. And nobody does it. Also, it's a filter. It's like, are you serious or are you not serious? I will help you if you're serious. Yes. But nine episode, you're not serious. This is the easy test.
  Speaker 1
  Exactly. Exactly. And the funny thing is too, is that it's like most people, if they go write a hundred blog posts and try to make each one better by the hundredth one, they don't need the advice anymore. They know what they're doing wrong. They know what they need to get better at.
  Speaker 2
