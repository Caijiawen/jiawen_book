  Speaker 1
  You search on Google for, hey, is it a good thing to run after money? And you'll get enough content around that. Hey, is it a good thing to not run after money? You'll get a lot of content around that. Hey, is it a good thing to be religious? You'll get a lot of content. Hey, is it a good thing to not follow religion? You'll get a lot of content. Google basically will serve you whatever is it that you want to know. It's almost as if it's tricking your mind and convincing you that what you think of is the truth. And that is the superpower of Google. That is actually why it is such a beautiful part of our daily life. And that is also how our mind works. Our mind is constantly tricking us. Our mind does not have a mind of its own. It's just following our command. So if we're telling our minds, this is really hard. I don't think I'll be able to do it. Guess what? Our mind will convince you that you cannot do it and give you 10,000 examples of how you haven't been able to do something in the past as well to validate your belief that you won't be able to do it. And the same stretch of imagination. If you were to convince or suggest to your mind that you can do it, that you have it in you to do it, your mind will suddenly play along. It'll give you 10,000 reasons and data points to convince you that you've done it in the past. You can do it again. You have it in you.
