## Highlights
- Optimism, obsession, self-belief, raw horsepower and personal connections are how things get started. 
  乐观、执着、自信、原始动力和人际关系是事情开始的方式。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr42ye2qwcja398yfcc88mb2))
- Cohesive teams, the right combination of calmness and urgency, and unreasonable commitment are how things get finished. Long-term orientation is in short supply; try not to worry about what people think in the short term, which will get easier over time. 
  有凝聚力的团队、冷静与紧迫感的恰当结合以及不合理的承诺，才能完成任务。长远的方向是供不应求的；尽量不要担心人们在短期内的想法，随着时间的推移，这会变得越来越容易。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr42ywy1tmtaejtf8szv3z9d))
- It is easier for a team to do a hard thing that really matters than to do an easy thing that doesn’t really matter; audacious ideas motivate people. 
  对一个团队来说，做一件真正重要的难事比做一件无关紧要的容易事更容易；大胆的想法会激励人们 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr4295jz1fambda264p4d224))
- Concentrate your resources on a small number of high-conviction bets; this is easy to say but evidently hard to do. You can delete more stuff than you think. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr42xzqxdjjn4np5kac64663))
- Outcomes are what count; don’t let good process excuse bad results. 
  结果才是最重要的，不要让好的过程成为坏结果的借口。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr42bvv9qgkh826714f367qj))
- Spend more time recruiting. Take risks on high-potential people with a fast rate of improvement. Look for evidence of getting stuff done in addition to intelligence. 
  花更多时间招聘。在潜力大、进步快的人身上冒险。除了聪明才智，还要看完成工作的证据。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr42f83ta9rh0fv768r50x22))
- Superstars are even more valuable than they seem, but you have to evaluate people on their net impact on the performance of the organization. 
  超级明星比他们看起来更有价值，但你必须根据他们对组织绩效的净影响来评估他们。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr42xh5abjcvax6xcw7689kj))
- Fast iteration can make up for a lot; it’s usually ok to be wrong if you iterate quickly. Plans should be measured in decades, execution should be measured in weeks. 
  快速迭代可以弥补很多不足；如果迭代速度快，通常出错也没关系。计划应以十年为单位，执行应以周为单位。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr42enkpsksr9r803mfvm22e))
- Inspiration is perishable and life goes by fast. Inaction is a particularly insidious type of risk. 
  灵感易逝，人生匆匆。不作为是一种特别隐蔽的风险。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr42edh319kfrjrygq02102w))
- Scale often has surprising emergent properties. 
  规模往往具有令人惊讶的新兴特性。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr42z7866p7mew0e5zfq3804))
- Working with great people is one of the best parts of life. 
  与优秀的人共事是生活中最美好的部分之一。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr42dx3jtzwhmgdt0rw548g7))
- 1) This is another example of what I think is going to be a new computer interface trend: you say what you want in natural language or with contextual clues, and the computer does it. We offer this for code and now image generation; both of these will get a lot better. But the same trend will happen in new ways until eventually it works for complex tasks—we can imagine an “AI office worker” that takes requests in natural language like a human does. 
  1) 这是我认为计算机界面新趋势的另一个例子：你用自然语言或上下文线索说出你想要的东西，计算机就能完成。我们为代码提供了这种功能，现在又为图像生成提供了这种功能。但同样的趋势也会以新的方式出现，直到最终适用于复杂的任务--我们可以想象一个 "人工智能办公人员"，它可以像人类一样用自然语言接受请求。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr43r7n3e41taqpsybwswws4))
- The best people in both groups spend a lot of time reflecting on some version of the Hamming question—"what are the most important problems in your field, and why aren’t you working on them?” In general, no one reflects on this question enough, but the best people do it the most, and have the best ‘problem taste’, which is some combination of learning to think independently, reason about the future, and identify attack vectors. (This from John Schulman is worth reading: [http://joschu.net/blog/opinionated-guide-ml-research.html](http://joschu.net/blog/opinionated-guide-ml-research.html)). 
  两组中最优秀的人都会花大量时间思考某个版本的汉明问题--"你所在领域最重要的问题是什么，你为什么不研究这些问题？一般来说，没有人会对这个问题进行足够的反思，但最优秀的人做得最多，他们的 "问题品味 "也最好，这是学习独立思考、推理未来和识别攻击载体的某种结合。(约翰-舒尔曼（John Schulman）的这篇文章值得一读：http://joschu.net/blog/opinionated-guide-ml-research.html）。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr448ddymgfbnp3rxmbz5qp8))
- But giving founders an idea almost always doesn’t work. Having ideas is among the most important qualities for a startup founder to have—you will need to generate lots of new ideas in the course of running a startup. 
  但是，给创始人一个想法几乎总是行不通的。拥有想法是初创企业创始人最重要的素质之一--在经营初创企业的过程中，你需要产生大量的新想法。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr428e16g87bvc79wkwx84rj))
- It’s also important to think about what you’re well-suited for. This is hard to do with pure introspection; ideally you can ask a mentor or some people you’ve worked with what you’re particularly good at. I’ve come to believe that founder/company fit is as important as product/market fit. 
  思考自己适合做什么也很重要。单纯的自省很难做到这一点；理想的情况是，你可以向导师或一些与你共事过的人询问你特别擅长什么。我认为，创始人/公司适合与产品/市场适合同样重要。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr45s10scryjvayrc5pj7cb2))
