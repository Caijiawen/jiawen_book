## Highlights
- Again, I quote Emerson: “That which we persist in doing becomes easier—not that the nature of the task has changed, but our ability to do has increased.”
- There is intrinsic security that comes from service, from helping other people in a meaningful way. One important source is your work, when you see yourself in a contributive and creative mode, really making a difference
- 业余的销售人员销售的是产品；专业的销售人员销售的是需求和问题的解决方案。
- “I really tried to put myself in his shoes. I tried to verbalize his needs and concerns, and he began to open up.
  "我真的试着设身处地为他着想。我试图用语言表达他的需求和关切，他开始敞开心扉。
  “The more I sensed and expressed the things he was worried about, the results he anticipated, the more he opened up.
  "我越是感觉到并表达他所担心的事情，他所预期的结果，他就越是敞开心扉。
- The essence of empathic listening is not that you agree with someone; it’s that you fully, deeply, understand that person, emotionally as well as intellectually.
- Seek first to understand” involves a very deep shift in paradigm. We typically seek first to be understood. Most people do not listen with the intent to understand; they listen with the intent to reply. They’re either speaking or preparing to speak. They’re filtering everything through their own paradigms, reading their autobiography into other people’s lives.

- First, see the problem from the other point of view. Really seek to understand and to give expression to the needs and concerns of the other party as well as or better than they can themselves.
  首先，从对方的角度看问题。真正寻求理解并表达对方的需求和关切，就像他们自己一样，甚至比他们自己做得更好。
- 他传授了我所见过的关于情感成熟度的最好、最简单、最实用而又深刻的定义--"表达自己的感受和信念的能力，同时兼顾他人的想法和感受。
- It is one thing to make a mistake, and quite another thing not to admit it. People will forgive mistakes, because mistakes are usually of the mind, mistakes of judgment. But people will not easily forgive the mistakes of the heart, the ill intention, the bad motives, the prideful justifying cover-up of the first mistake.

- 存款是在一开始就把期望变得清晰和明确。这需要在前面投入真正的时间和精力，但它在后面可以节省大量的时间和精力。
- 遵守承诺或保证是一个重要的存款；违背承诺是一个重要的提款。事实上，可能没有比做出对某人很重要的承诺，然后又不兑现更大规模的提款了。下次再做承诺时，他们就不会相信了。
- Daddy, if I were cold, would you put your coat around me, too?”
  "爸爸，如果我很冷，你也会把你的外套放在我身上吗？"
- 我有一个朋友，他的儿子对棒球产生了狂热的兴趣。我的朋友对棒球一点都不感兴趣。但是有一年夏天，他带着他的儿子去看每一个大联盟球队的比赛。这次旅行花了六个多星期，花了一大笔钱，但这成为他们关系中一个强大的纽带经验。
  My friend was asked on his return, “Do you like baseball that much?”
  我的朋友回来后被问到："你这么喜欢棒球吗？"
  “No,” he replied, “but I like my son that much.”
  "不，"他回答，"但我很喜欢我的儿子。"
- 真正寻求了解另一个人可能是你能做出的最重要的存款之一，它是其他所有存款的关键。在你了解另一个人之前，你根本不知道什么才是对另一个人的存款。
- 如果我通过礼貌、仁慈、诚实和遵守对你的承诺，向你的情感银行账户存款，我就会建立起一个储备。你对我的信任变得更高，如果我需要，我可以多次调用这种信任。我甚至可以犯错，而这种信任程度，这种情感储备，会对它进行补偿。
- 信任是人类动力的最高形式。它能激发出人们的最佳状态。但它需要时间和耐心，而且它不排除有必要培训和发展人们，使他们的能力能够上升到这种信任的水平。
- 问责制。制定评估结果的绩效标准，并确定报告和评估的具体时间。
- 预期结果。对需要完成的任务建立明确的相互理解，重点是什么，而不是如何；结果，而不是方法。花点时间。要有耐心。将期望的结果可视化。让对方看到它，描述它，做出一个高质量的声明，说明结果将是什么样子，以及何时完成。
- 管家式授权注重的是结果而不是方法。它让人们选择方法，让他们对结果负责。在开始时需要更多的时间，但这是很好的投资时间。你可以把支点移过去，你可以通过管理授权增加你的杠杆作用。
- effectively delegating to others is perhaps the single most powerful high-leverage activity there is.
- SELECTING GOALS. The next step is to think of one or two important results you feel you should accomplish in each role during the next seven days. These would be recorded as goals.
- SCHEDULING. Now you can look at the week ahead with your goals in mind and schedule time to achieve them
- Most people think in terms of weeks. But most third-generation planning tools focus on daily planning. While they may help you prioritize your activities, they basically only help you organize crises and busywork. The key is not to prioritize what’s on your schedule, but to schedule your priorities. And this can best be done in the context of the week.
- QUADRANT II FOCUS. You need a tool that encourages you, motivates you, actually helps you spend the time you need in Quadrant II, so that you’re dealing with prevention rather than prioritizing crises. In my opinion, the best way to do this is to organize your life on a weekly basis. You can still adapt and prioritize on a daily basis, but the fundamental thrust is organizing the week.
- Quadrant II is the heart of effective personal management. It deals with things that are not urgent, but are important. It deals with things like building relationships, writing a personal mission statement, long-range planning,exercising, preventive maintenance, preparation—all those things we know we need to do, but somehow seldom get around to doing, because they aren’t urgent.第二象限是有效个人管理的核心。它处理的是那些不紧急但却很重要的事情。它处理的事情包括建立关系、撰写个人使命宣言、长期规划、锻炼、预防性维护、准备--所有这些我们知道需要做的事情，但不知为何很少去做，因为它们并不紧急
- Habit 3, then, is the second creation, the physical creation. It’s the fulfillment,the actualization, the natural emergence of Habits 1 and 2. It’s the exercise of independent will toward becoming principle-centered. It’s the day-in,day-out, moment-by-moment doing it.
- Habit 2 is the first or mental creation. It’s based on imagination—the ability to envision, to see the potential, to create with our minds what we cannot at present see with our eyes; and conscience—the ability to detect our own uniqueness and the personal, moral, and ethical guidelines within which we can most happily fulfill it. It’s the deep contact with our basic paradigms and values and the vision of what we can become.
- Habit 1 says, “You’re the creator. You are in charge.” It’s based on the four unique human endowments of imagination, conscience, independent will, and,particularly, self-awareness. It empowers you to say, “That’s an unhealthy program I’ve been given from my childhood, from my social mirror. I don’t like that ineffective script. I can change.”
- One of the main things his research showed was that almost all of the world-class athletes and other peak performers are visualizers. They see it; they feel it; they experience it before they actually do it. They begin with the end in mind.他的研究表明，几乎所有的世界级运动员和其他巅峰表现者都是可视化的。他们看到它；他们感觉到它；他们在真正做之前就已经体验到了。他们在开始时就考虑到了目的。
- You can visualize your retirement from your present occupation. What contributions, what achievements will you want to have made in your field?What plans will you have after retirement? Will you enter a second career?你可以想象一下你从现在的职业中退休的情景。你希望在你的领域做出什么贡献，取得什么成就？退休后你会有什么计划？你会进入第二职业吗？
- You can visualize your twenty-fifth and then your fiftieth wedding anniversary. Have your spouse visualize this with you. Try to capture the essence of the family relationship you want to have created through your day-by-day investment over a period of that many years.你可以想象你的第25个结婚纪念日，然后是第50个结婚纪念日。让你的配偶和你一起想象一下。试着捕捉你希望通过你在这么多年里的逐日投资而建立的家庭关系的本质。
- There are a number of ways to do this. Through the powers of your imagination, you can visualize your own funeral, as we did at the beginning of this chapter. Write your own eulogy. Actually write it out. Be specific.有许多方法可以做到这一点。通过你的想象力，你可以想象自己的葬礼，就像我们在本章开头所做的那样。写下你自己的悼词。真的写出来。要具体。
- As proactive people, we can begin to give expression to what we want to be and to do in our lives. We can write a personal mission statement, a personal constitution.作为积极主动的人，我们可以开始表达我们在生活中想要成为什么和做什么。我们可以写一份个人使命宣言，一份个人宪法。
- I will be a self-starting individual who exercises initiative in accomplishing my life’s goals. I will act on situations and opportunities,rather than to be acted upon.我将是一个自我启动的人，在完成我的生活目标方面发挥主动性。我将根据情况和机会采取行动，而不是被采取行动
- "斯蒂芬，当你在第二个月指出领导和管理之间的区别时，我看了看我作为这家公司总裁的角色，意识到我从未进入过领导层。我深陷于管理之中，被紧迫的挑战和日常后勤的细节所埋没。所以我决定退出管理。我可以让其他人来做这件事。我想真正领导我的组织。
- I’m convinced that too often parents are also trapped in the management paradigm, thinking of control, efficiency, and rules instead of direction,purpose, and family feeling.我相信，父母往往也被困在管理模式中，想到的是控制、效率和规则，而不是方向、目的和家庭感受。
- In the words of both Peter Drucker and Warren Bennis,“Management is doing things right; leadership is doing the right things.”Management is efficiency in climbing the ladder of success; leadership determines whether the ladder is leaning against the right wall.
- “Begin with the end in mind” is based on the principle that all things are created twice. There’s a mental or first creation, and a physical or second creation, to all things."以终为始 "是基于所有事物都是两次创造的原则。所有事物都有一个心理或第一创造，以及一个物理或第二创造。Take the construction of a home, for example. You create it in every detail before you ever hammer the first nail into place. You try to get a very clear sense of what kind of house you want.
- 当我们真正知道什么对我们来说是非常重要的时候，我们的生活是多么的不同，而且，我们牢记这一点，每天管理自己，成为和做真正最重要的东西。如果梯子没有靠在正确的墙上，我们所走的每一步都会让我们更快地到达错误的地方。我们可能会很忙，我们可能会很有效率，但只有当我们以目的为出发点时，我们才会真正有效。
- Now think deeply. What would you like each of these speakers to say about you and your life? What kind of husband, wife, father, or mother would you like their words to reflect? What kind of son or daughter or cousin? What kind of friend? What kind of working associate?现在深入思考。你希望这些发言人中的每个人对你和你的生活说些什么？你希望他们的话反映出什么样的丈夫、妻子、父亲或母亲？什么样的儿子或女儿或表妹？什么样的朋友？什么样的工作伙伴？
- 当你走到房间的前面，看着棺材里面，你突然面对自己。
- The proactive approach to a mistake is to acknowledge it instantly, correct and learn from it. This literally turns a failure into a success. “Success,” said IBM founder T. J. Watson, “is on the far side of failure.”对待错误的积极态度是立即承认错误，纠正错误并从中吸取教训。这实际上是将失败变成了成功。"成功，"IBM创始人T.J.Watson说，"就在失败的远方。"
- But that’s the difference between positive thinking and proactivity. We did face reality. We faced the reality of the current circumstance and of future projections. But we also faced the reality that we had the power to choose a positive response to those circumstances and projections. Not facing reality would have been to accept the idea that what’s happening in our environment had to determine us.但这就是积极思考和积极行动之间的区别。我们确实面对了现实。我们面对的是当前环境和未来预测的现实。但我们也面对现实，我们有能力选择对这些情况和预测作出积极的反应。如果不面对现实，就会接受这样的想法：我们环境中发生的事情必须决定我们。
- Taking initiative does not mean being pushy, obnoxious, or aggressive. It does mean recognizing our responsibility to make things happen.主动性并不意味着咄咄逼人、令人厌恶或咄咄逼人。它确实意味着认识到我们有责任使事情发生。
- As Eleanor Roosevelt observed, “No one can hurt you without your consent.”In the words of Gandhi, “They cannot take away our self respect if we do not give it to them.” It is our willing permission, our consent to what happens to us, that hurts us far more than what happens to us in the first place.正如埃莉诺-罗斯福所言，"没有你的同意，没有人可以伤害你"。用甘地的话说，"如果我们不给他们自尊，他们就无法夺走我们的自尊"。正是我们的自愿许可，我们对发生在我们身上的事情的同意，对我们的伤害远远大于首先发生在我们身上的事情
- Reactive people are often affected by their physical environment. If the weather is good, they feel good.If it isn’t, it affects their attitude and their performance. Proactive people can carry their own weather with them. Whether it rains or shines makes no difference to them.

- I know of no more encouraging fact than the unquestionable ability of man to elevate his life by conscious endeavor.我所知道的最令人鼓舞的事实莫过于人类通过有意识的努力来提升自己的生活的能力，这是毋庸置疑的。HENRY DAVID THOREAU亨利-戴维-梭罗
- Dependent people need others to get what they want. Independent people can get what they want through their own effort. Interdependent people combine their own efforts with the efforts of others to achieve their greatest success.依赖性强的人需要别人来获得他们想要的东西。独立的人可以通过自己的努力得到他们想要的东西。相互依赖的人将自己的努力与他人的努力结合起来，取得最大的成功。
- Habits, too, have tremendous gravity pull—more than most people realize or would admit. Breaking deeply imbedded habitual tendencies such as procrastination, impatience, criticalness, or selfishness that violate basic principles of human effectiveness involves more than a little willpower and a few minor changes in our lives. “Lift off” takes a tremendous effort, but once we break out of the gravity pull, our freedom takes on a whole new dimension.
- We must not cease from exploration and the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we began and to know the place for the first time.我们决不能停止探索，我们所有探索的终点将是到达我们开始的地方，并第一次认识这个地方。
- It says if you want to have a happy marriage, be the kind of person who generates positive energy and sidesteps negative energy rather than empowering it. If you want to have a more pleasant, cooperative teenager, bea more understanding, empathic, consistent, loving parent.
- 我的经验是，有的时候要教，有的时候不要教。当关系紧张，空气中充满情绪时，试图教导往往被认为是一种判断和拒绝。但是，当关系良好时，把孩子单独带走，安静地讨论教学或价值，似乎有更大的影响。可能是做这件事的情感成熟度超出了我当时的耐心和内部控制水平。
- On a ten-point scale, if I am at level two in any field, and desire to move to level five, I must first take the step toward level three. “A thousand-mile journey begins with the first step” and can only be taken one step at a time.在10分制下，如果我在任何领域处于第二级，并希望升至第五级，我必须首先向第三级迈出一步。"千里之行，始于足下"，只能一步一步地走下去。
- Another principle is human dignity. The basic concept in the United States Declaration of Independence bespeaks this value or principle. “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.”另一个原则是人的尊严。美国《独立宣言》中的基本概念就体现了这一价值或原则。"我们认为这些真理是不言而喻的，人人生而平等，造物主赋予他们某些不可剥夺的权利，其中包括生命、自由和对幸福的追求"。
- Other examples would include integrity and honesty. They create the foundation of trust which is essential to cooperation and long-term personal and interpersonal growth.其他例子还包括正直和诚实。它们创造了信任的基础，这对合作和长期的个人和人际关系的成长至关重要。
- We don’t need to protect you,” was the unspoken message. “You’re fundamentally okay.”
- “Begin with the end in mind” is based on the principle that all things are created twice. There’s a mental or first creation, and a physical or second creation, to all things."以终为始 "是基于所有事物都是两次创造的原则。所有事物都有一个心理或第一创造，以及一个物理或第二创造。Take the construction of a home, for example. You create it in every detail before you ever hammer the first nail into place. You try to get a very clear sense of what kind of house you want.
