- Summary: You need to make sure you’re accomplishing 3 things for an effective muscle building diet plan: eating at a slight calorie deficit, eating adequate protein every day, and not eating like complete crap.

This way you’ll be able to occasionally re-sensitize your body to put on muscle more efficiently. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3f70cat1xdc0e5ddy297y08))
