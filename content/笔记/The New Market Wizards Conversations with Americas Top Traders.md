### Misadventures in Trading On the lecture tour following the completion of this book’s predecessor, Market Wizards, certain questions came up with reliable frequency. One common question was: “Has your own trading improved dramatically now that you’ve just finished interviewing some of the world’s best traders?” Although I had the advantage of having plenty of room for dramatic improvement in my trading, my response was a bit of a cop-out. “Well,” I would answer, “I don’t know. You see, at the moment, I’m not trading.” While it may seem a bit heretical for the author of Market Wizards not to be trading, there was a perfectly good reason for my inaction. One of the cardinal rules about trading is (or should be): Don’t trade when you can’t afford to lose. In fact, there are few more certain ways of guaranteeing that you will lose than by trading money you can’t afford to lose. If your trading capital is too important, you will be doomed to a number of fatal errors. You will miss out on som

> 📌 Moving ahead to then-current times, he showed a magazine cover that read: “How High Can Oil Prices Go?” This story was written at the time of skyrocketing oil prices in the months following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. “My guess is that we’ve probably seen the top of the oil market”, said Ed. He was right.

### Bill Lipschutz THE SULTAN OF CURRENCIES Quick, what is the world’s largest financial market? Stocks? No, not even if you aggregate all the world’s equity markets. Of course, it must be bonds. Just think of the huge government debt that has been generated worldwide. Good guess, but wrong again, even if you combine all the world’s fixed-income markets. The correct answer is currencies. In the scope of all financial trading, stocks and bonds are peanuts compared with currencies. It is estimated that, on average, $1 trillion is traded each day in the world currency markets. The vast majority of this currency trading does not take place on any organized exchange but rather is transacted in the interbank currency market. The interbank currency market is a twenty-four-hour market, which literally follows the sun around the world, moving from banking centers of the United States, to Australia, to the Far East, to Europe, and finally back to the United States. The market exists to fill the need

> 📌 Yes. Not everyone is going to interpret things in the same way, at the same time, as you do, and it’s important to understand that. You need to be plugged into the news and to know what the market is looking at.
