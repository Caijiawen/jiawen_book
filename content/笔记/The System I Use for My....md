- ü§ì Step 1 - Conceptualise 
  Start by coming up with a bunch of business ideas.
  Try to find something that‚Äôs in the middle of: 
  1. What you like
  2. What there‚Äôs a market for 
  3. What you can be the best at
  Feel free to use AI for these ideas :) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AliAbdaal/status/1661010170938552322))
- üèó Step 2 - Assemble your MVP.
  Instead of spending 6+ months perfecting a product, create a free minimum viable product (MVP).
  MVP = a product with just enough features to generate leads and find out if it's something people would buy. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AliAbdaal/status/1661010173123768324))
- Two examples of MVPs are: Webinars & Scorecards.
  E.g. for a webinar, create one teaching people about your desired business. 
  E.g. For scorecards, create one (using ScoreApp) asking questions related to your business, which helps to validate your business idea. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AliAbdaal/status/1661010175795527680))
- Btw if you‚Äôre interested in starting a business, I‚Äôm doing a workshop with Daniel Priestley tomorrow (Wednesday 24 May), where you‚Äôll learn everything you need to know about building a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and generating leads using Scorecard marketing.

- The knowledge I've gained from Daniel and using scorecards has directly translated into $2M worth of sales to my business, so it‚Äôs well worth checking out and it‚Äôs totally free.

- ü§ù Step 3 -Shape your product towards market fit.
  Use your scorecard as a survey to find out what people in the market want.
  You might‚Äôve thought your product would be A but the market tells you they want B instead.
  Use this information to shape your product towards B. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AliAbdaal/status/1661010184729399301))
- üôå Step 5 - Scale & expand your business. 
  It‚Äôs time to get your product into new: 
  1. Markets
  2. Audiences
  3. Locations
  I‚Äôm no expert, but 2 great books I always recommend for this are $100M Offers & Dotcom Secrets. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AliAbdaal/status/1661010190035214338))
