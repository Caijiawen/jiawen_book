## Highlights
- And I did it to deepen my relationships with my friends because I could do I did all sorts of Google sleuthing that would be creepy otherwise and make it Charlie Rose for my friends and also to remove verbal texts and get better at asking questions and follow-up questions and weaving conversations which is something I was already doing for the non-fiction books. 
  我这样做是为了加深与朋友们的关系，因为我可以在谷歌上做各种调查，否则会让人毛骨悚然，也可以让我的朋友们看到《查理-罗斯》，还可以删除口头文字，更好地提问、追问和编织对话，这是我在非小说类书籍中已经在做的事情。

  So the way I viewed it was as cross-training for later transfer to my non-fiction book writing and research. That worked but then podcasts and my podcasts Took on a life of their own and then it turned into business. 
  因此，我将其视为交叉训练，以便日后转入非虚构类书籍的写作和研究。这样做是行得通的，但后来播客和我的播客有了自己的生命，然后就变成了生意。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hw09nbaj4z12aem6m468b478))
- then I can pretty reliably end up in what I would consider a state of flow, where there's a certain It's not like a psychedelic experience, but it's a minimizing of the self that is very relaxing to me. 
  然后，我就能很稳定地进入我认为的 "流动 "状态，在这种状态下，我有一种不像是迷幻的体验，而是一种自我最小化的状态，这让我非常放松。
  17:15
  It's very intently focused, but in this case, it's also very relaxing at the same time. 
  它非常专注，但同时也非常放松。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hw0aj6dwekfk7jn6wwka2we5))
- One thing you can do is read interviews as much as you listen to them and you'll pick up a bit more of what the interviewer is doing. It's kind of like watching sleight of hand in slow motion. You'll have a better view of things. 
  有一件事你可以做，那就是像听采访一样阅读采访，这样你就能更多地了解采访者在做什么。这有点像慢动作看魔术。你会看得更清楚。
  18:30
  So when I was starting the podcast, I mentioned James Lipton. I hired one of his former researchers to go through my transcripts with me and show me where I could have improved. 
  因此，当我开始播客时，我提到了詹姆斯-李普顿。我聘请了他的一位前任研究员和我一起查看我的记录稿，告诉我哪里可以改进。
  18:38
  Now, if you're just improving your conversational abilities and not doing a podcast, then maybe you don't want to do that. Although my recommendation to everybody listening would be record six to 10 episodes of podcast. 
  现在，如果你只是想提高你的对话能力，而不是做一个播客，那么也许你并不想这样做。不过，我建议每个听众都录制 6 到 10 集的播客。
  18:49
  It's so cheap for a hundred bucks. You can have a good mic, just get it done and listen to yourself and look at a transcript and you will notice plenty of things you want to fix. So that would be a very easy recommendation. 
  这一百块钱太便宜了。你可以有一个好的麦克风，只要把它弄好，听一听自己的声音，看一看录音记录，你就会发现有很多需要修正的地方。因此，这将是一个非常简单的建议。
  19:02
  And if You wonder what the conversation should be? Interview your parents. Do something for posterity. Interview your kids. Interview one of your best friends and have a couple drinks. 
  如果你想知道该如何对话？采访你的父母。为子孙后代做点什么。采访你的孩子采访你最好的朋友之一，然后喝上几杯。
  19:12
  Other recommendations would be to ask very basic follow-ups. The reason for that is that most humans who interact a lot have set pieces, even if they don't realize they have set pieces. 
  其他建议是提出非常基本的追问。这样做的原因是，大多数经常互动的人都有固定的思维模式，即使他们没有意识到自己有固定的思维模式。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hw0amf0yzk3xab7wdd1b2szc))
- And then I would also say let the silence do the work. This was advice that I got from Cal Fussman way back in the day who wrote the What I Learned column for Esquire magazine for ages, interviewed Muhammad Ali, Corbett Shuff, you name it. 
  然后我还会说，让沉默发挥作用。这是我当年从卡尔-福斯曼那里得到的建议，他为《Esquire》杂志撰写 "我学到了什么 "专栏多年，采访过穆罕默德-阿里、科贝特-舒夫等人。
  20:28
  And his feedback to me when he listened to the first handful of my podcast was let the silence do the work. Give a little bit more space. So that it gets a little uncomfortable and people will give you more. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hw0b1f6wwfrka21j4ephgfg6))
- 如果他们不让你插嘴，而你只是沉默不语，最终他们会暂停，然后你就可以插嘴了。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hw0b5z9ejgwn0ak4hqnsa64a))
- I usually try to start the conversation with a question that reflects a deep level of prep and research, especially with people who have been interviewed a lot because I want them to turn off the autopilot. 
  我通常会试着用一个能反映深层次准备和研究的问题来开始谈话，尤其是对那些经常接受采访的人，因为我希望他们能关掉自动驾驶仪。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hw0b8xgwmswf0xnpa6tc19z0))
- And I would say all of the mentors I can think of, most of the mentors, not all, have a pretty tough love style. I don't think it's possible to reach your potential of excellence in any given field without somebody, ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hw0bfwq81jefsc0pkzfmjbv7))
