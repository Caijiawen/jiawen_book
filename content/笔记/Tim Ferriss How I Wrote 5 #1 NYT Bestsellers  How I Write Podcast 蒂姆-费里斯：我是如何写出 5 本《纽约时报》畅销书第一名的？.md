## Highlights
- Do something interesting first. You can take like A-plus material with B-minus writing and come out with something that people really want to pay attention to. My books are not short, in case you haven't noticed. They are big. 
  先做一些有趣的事情。你可以用A+的素材加上B-的文笔，写出人们真正愿意关注的东西。如果你没注意到，我的书并不短。它们很大。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxg4bbnftq8y4h1e5swtmfge))
- I have effectively walls of notebooks going back To when I was probably 16 or 17. I mean, I've almost every workout I've ever done recorded as an example. Oh, wow. That's just one category. 
  我有一整面墙的笔记本，可以追溯到我大概十六七岁的时候。我的意思是，我几乎把我做过的每一次锻炼都记录了下来。哦，哇这只是一个类别。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxg4car9kt0cswmf3xxm5ej7))
- If the writing's not working, if you don't know what to do next, for me, the first question is, have you done enough research? Do you have enough raw material? If not, get more. 
  如果写作没有效果，如果你不知道下一步该做什么，对我来说，第一个问题是，你做了足够的研究吗？你有足够的原材料吗？如果没有，那就多找一些。
  02:08
  If you don't have something interesting to write about, you haven't done something interesting, go do something interesting. 
  如果你没有有趣的东西可写，你没有做过有趣的事，那就去做有趣的事吧。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxg4cy5yx4a1rhd70tqn9pb9))
- The first was a lecture, so every week we'd sit down and for three hours or whatever it was, McPhee would get up and he'd sketch out structures and he would explain pieces and Teach us the lessons that he had learned. 
  第一种是讲座，每周我们都会坐下来，在三个小时或更长的时间里，麦克菲会站起来，勾勒出结构图，解释作品，并向我们传授他学到的经验。
  03:37
  The other piece was once a week. I want to say it was once a week. We had independent writing assignments and then you would get one-on-one time with McPhee and he would come in with, 
  另一块是每周一次。我想说是一周一次。我们有独立的写作任务，然后你会有和麦克菲一对一的时间，他会带着你一起去、
  03:46
  let's just say it's five pages and there'd be more red ink than your original black ink of his notes and then you'd sit down and you'd look at his notes and he'd walk you through and he'd explain his notes and that is, 
  你坐下来，看着他的笔记，他会带你看一遍，并解释他的笔记，这就是他的笔记、
  03:57
  I knew it then but even now I I would say I appreciate it more. I think draft number four does a pretty good job of running people through a lot of the content from that course. 
  我当时就知道这一点，但即使是现在，我也会说我更欣赏它了。我认为第四稿很好地向人们介绍了该课程的许多内容。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxg4g45bv9hq2ktzbb11fq1d))
- was trying to sound fancy or dress up your writing in some way that was patently absurd to someone with the keen eye of a McPhee, right? You'd be like, what does this word mean? 
  是想让自己的文章听起来花里胡哨，还是想用某种方式来装扮自己的文章，而这种方式对于一个有着麦菲般敏锐眼光的人来说显然是荒谬的，对吗？你会想，这个词是什么意思？
  05:08
  And then you would not be able to defend it and you'd be like... What does this sentence mean? What are you trying to say here? Remove. 
  然后你就无法为它辩护，你就会觉得......这句话是什么意思？你想说什么？去掉
  05:16
  And as he excised these things from my writing, my thinking became much crisper and my grades in all my other classes that I can remember went up. So it wasn't just writing, it was revising writing, which is revising thinking, 
  当他从我的写作中删除这些内容时，我的思维变得更加清晰，我记得的其他课程的成绩也都上升了。所以，这不仅仅是写作，而是修改写作，也就是修改思维、 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxg4mmg6s6h5xg01chxm2f5t))
- So the fact that we had a small class size, the fact that he had been doing this for a very long time, revising it, revising it, revising it, refining it, refining it. 
  因此，我们的班级规模很小，而且他已经做了很长时间，不断修改、修改、修改、完善、完善。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxg4nyscvsezbnae39qc79er))
- I'll switch the mode to suggesting as opposed to editing and I'll redline And then either do say a Zoom screen share or because we do almost everything remotely, use something like Loom and walk through and explain my red lines. 
  我会将模式切换为建议模式，而不是编辑模式，然后划出红线，然后进行 Zoom 屏幕共享，或者因为我们几乎所有的工作都是远程完成的，所以可以使用 Loom 等软件，然后走一遍并解释我的红线。
  10:31
  It's not enough to just give someone a red line. The rationale behind the red lines is what matters. And in that way, you can over time, email draft by email draft. Refine thinking and writing surprisingly quickly. 
  仅仅给别人划红线是不够的。红线背后的理由才是最重要的。这样，随着时间的推移，你就能逐一起草电子邮件草稿。以惊人的速度完善思维和写作。
  10:50
  And so there have been long-standing results. I actually still have all of my notes from McPhee's class in a box. 
  于是就有了长期的成果。实际上，我在麦克菲课堂上的所有笔记都还保存在一个盒子里。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxg4s8anssq9cdms4yafztq4))
- Let's just say I have an idea percolating for a book, whether that's for our chef, including say a lot on accelerated learning for our body, whatever. I would use the web clipper for Evernote. 
  比方说，我有一个写书的想法，不管是为我们的厨师写的，还是为我们的身体写的，包括很多关于加速学习的内容，等等。我会使用 Evernote 的网络剪贴板。
  15:59
  If I came across anything that was sent to me, anything that I found, a scientific study, an interview that I thought might be relevant. I would web clip that and take it into Evernote. 
  如果我遇到别人发给我的东西、我发现的东西、我认为可能相关的科学研究或访谈。我就会将其剪辑到 Evernote 中。
  16:10
  I would also take Evernote notes, and I use more tools now, but Evernote was the default for a very long time. 
  我也会用 Evernote 做笔记，现在我用的工具更多了，但 Evernote 在很长一段时间内都是默认的。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxg85jyzeb4ndwgzrw9dx8cx))
- Just a speculation, but I think that would probably hold. The second is I have no competitive advantage. If it's digesting books and pulling anecdotes and stories and facts and figures from books, anybody can do that. 
  这只是一种推测，但我认为很可能成立。第二，我没有竞争优势。如果是消化书籍，从书中摘录轶事、故事、事实和数据，任何人都能做到。
  17:58
  And increasingly so, anyone can do that. Not to derail this whole conversation with AI, 
  越来越多的人可以做到这一点。我不想把整个话题扯到人工智能上、
  18:04
  but the process of doing that type of thing Through research or honestly just getting very good at spellcasting with good queries in chat GPT or other tools, you will not have a competitive advantage. 
  但在做这类事情的过程中，通过研究，或者老实说通过在聊天 GPT 或其他工具中进行良好的查询来获得非常好的咒语，你将不会有竞争优势。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxg8r2vsx92jerbk5pbvv77n))
- My competitive advantage is for at least the foreseeable next few years, no iRobot is going to be going out and doing the hair brand experiments that I do to myself and then writing about them in a personalized way. 
  我的竞争优势在于，至少在可预见的未来几年内，不会有 iRobot 公司去做我给自己做的头发品牌实验，然后以个性化的方式对其进行报道。
  18:29
  That's harder to imitate. It's harder for anyone to imitate because it is It is higher labor and there are more barriers to entry. So if I want to write compelling writing and if I want to write something that is highly differentiated, 
  这更难模仿。任何人都很难模仿，因为它的劳动强度更高，进入门槛也更高。因此，如果我想写出引人入胜的作品，如果我想写出与众不同的作品、
  18:48
  I would say most of it's going to lean towards experimentation or reporting on someone else's experimentation that has not been captured. 
  我想说的是，大部分作品都会偏向于实验，或者报道别人未被记录的实验。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxg8rv9fmyttcv2z4mgwerg8))
- This is going to become increasingly scarce and increasingly valuable. I think reputation and credibility is like the new gold. 
  这将变得越来越稀缺，越来越珍贵。我认为，声誉和信誉就像新的黄金。
  21:13
  And there is a certain finite supply, at least a finite amount of trust that any consumer, any person can put into other people. And so they're going to choose the people with the highest signal of credibility for them. 
  任何消费者、任何人对他人的信任都是有限的，至少是有限的。因此，他们会选择可信度最高的人。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxg8tccx8pnzrv6fq4e065v3))
- I would say content is king. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxg8yjqr7ndtqx8fpyrkq05p))
- Small class, seminar plus one-on-one, you're getting to hear other students writing and you realize how much of a Rashomon game this ends up being. If you haven't seen Rashomon, go watch it. Akira Kurosawa, amazing film. 
  小班授课，研讨加一对一，你可以听到其他学生的写作，你会意识到这最终会成为一场罗生门游戏。如果你没看过《罗生门》，那就去看吧。黑泽明，了不起的电影。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxg913ry041e80kadnmk80e6))
- There's so many different approaches, but the The principle I'm trying to underscore is when in doubt, do something more interesting, like the what instead of the how. 
  有很多不同的方法，但我想强调的原则是，当有疑问时，做一些更有趣的事情，比如 "做什么 "而不是 "怎么做"。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxg9251qf9gtt97d81vg6mv5))
- So you can take like A plus material with B minus writing and come out with something that people really want to pay attention to than I think to do the opposite. 
  因此，与我认为的反其道而行之相比，你可以用 A+的材料加上 B+的写作，创作出人们真正愿意关注的作品。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxg932a4awpcmnm4czw8yh23))
- If you are connecting with your audience predominantly through Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, whatever it might be, you're renting your audience. If you do not own a direct means of communication, 
  如果你主要通过 Facebook、Instagram、TikTok 等方式与受众联系，那么你就是在租用受众。如果你没有直接的交流方式、
  29:49
  there might be exceptions where you can export and perhaps there are workarounds, but fundamentally, there are a couple of things that are proclaimed dead every year, okay? 
  也许有例外情况可以出口，也许有变通办法，但从根本上说，每年都有几件事情被宣布死亡，好吗？
  30:00
  Blogs are dead, email's dead, this is dead, and yet they are still here. And yeah, all the kids now, they're never going to use email. I'm like, yeah, until they get a job. And then guess what? They're going to use email. 
  博客死了，电子邮件死了，这一切都死了，但他们还在这里。是啊，现在所有的孩子都不会用电子邮件了。我想，是啊，直到他们找到工作。然后你猜怎么着？他们会用电子邮件
  30:15
  So, I recognize the importance of having that direct means of communication. I wanted to do something novel, wanted to experiment with a new format. 
  因此，我认识到这种直接交流方式的重要性。我想做一些新颖的事情，想尝试一种新的形式。
  30:25
  I also wanted to try to resurrect my writing, which I had backed off of in a really significant way because the podcast was easier. The podcast was fun. The podcast had my full attention. It was far more lucrative than any writing I could do. 
  我还想尝试复活我的写作，因为播客比较简单，所以我在很大程度上放弃了写作。播客很有趣。播客让我全神贯注。它比我能做的任何写作都要赚钱得多。
  30:44
  Yet, I wanted to continue to sharpen the axe. 
  然而，我还想继续磨斧头。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxg98c7gjfg3t401rhr61z9y))
- It was important to me because... I think you become a slower, duller thinker if you don't write regularly. You will get worse. And writing is like an annual checkup or a doctor's checkup for your thinking. 
  这对我很重要，因为...我认为如果你不经常写作 你的思维会变得迟钝迟钝你会变得更糟。写作就像是每年一次的体检 或者是医生对你的思维的检查
  31:16
  So, I feel compelled to write, at the very least, just to check how sloppy or tight my thinking is. And with the newsletter, which has whatever it is, 2 million plus subscribers now, the 5 bullet Friday, 
  因此，我觉得自己不得不写，至少是为了检查一下自己的思维是多么马虎或严密。我的时事通讯现在已经有 200 多万订阅者了，"星期五五颗子弹 "就是其中之一、
  31:35
  which is the name of it, was important because it set the Pass field mark at a really low bar. Does that make sense? Five bullets. That's it. 
  这个名字很重要，因为它将及格线的标准定得非常低。有道理吗？五颗子弹就是这样。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxg99y91yca0cvmcv6mkqhha))
- Two crappy pages a day. 
  每天两页蹩脚的网页。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxg9b77nv1jk5zb3y852vwg0))
- Yeah, there's a nice bit from your interview with Jerry Seinfeld, where he says, early in the process, you want to treat yourself like a baby. And whatever goes, oh, do whatever, play around, and then later on, you're like a sergeant. 
  你在采访杰瑞-宋飞（Jerry Seinfeld）的时候说过一句话 他说，在创作初期，你要把自己当成一个婴儿。不管做什么，哦，做什么，随便玩玩 然后到后来，你就像个中士了 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxgkz8rwypx0exhq6dxfjz01))
- And then some people are very easygoing, go with the flow, and they probably need, just like the yoga people need to do more weights and the weight people need to do more yoga. It's always a matter of trade-offs. 
  有些人很随和，随波逐流，他们可能需要，就像练瑜伽的人需要多练举重，练举重的人需要多练瑜伽一样。这总是一个取舍的问题。
  36:05
  If you have any superpowers, you're going to have super weaknesses. It's not a question of fixing the super weaknesses. 
  如果你有任何超能力，你就会有超级弱点。这不是解决超级弱点的问题。
  36:10
  It's just like, all right, how can you leverage your strengths while addressing the weaknesses enough, if need be, such that you can continue to play whatever long game you've committed to. 
  这就好比，好吧，如果需要的话，你如何才能在利用自己的优势的同时，解决足够多的弱点，这样你就可以继续玩你已经承诺的长期游戏。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxgm0d5yejdggwvw6e5q3y2p))
- So people can look that up and they can unpack that on their own. But I love fantasy and I love sci-fi. I read a lot of fiction actually. 
  所以人们可以自己去查，自己去解读。但我喜欢幻想，也喜欢科幻。事实上，我读了很多小说。
  38:04
  And I wanted to actually publish, not just write, because I'd done like small, tiny fiction experiments on my own and never shared it with anybody. 
  我想真正发表作品，而不仅仅是写作，因为我自己做了一些很小很小的小说实验，但从未与人分享过。
  38:14
  I wanted to actually force myself to publish to face that discomfort for a number of reasons and to experiment with world building. This is ongoing. 
  出于种种原因，我想强迫自己发表作品，以面对这种不适感，并尝试构建世界。这项工作正在进行中。
  38:25
  So I ended up writing 13, I want to say, chapters about describing the histories of various greater houses and mythologies and intertwining political alliances and old enemies and all this stuff about this fantasy realm. 
  最后，我写了 13 章，我想说的是，描述了各个大家族的历史、神话、交织在一起的政治联盟和宿敌，以及所有关于这个奇幻王国的东西。
  38:42
  That was part of experimenting with format. Cause like what works for me in nonfiction, there's certain, there's certain tools and certain tricks and kind of literary devices that you can transplant, but it's also a very different thing. 
  这也是格式实验的一部分因为对我来说，非虚构作品有一定的工具、技巧和文学手段可以移植，但这也是一件非常不同的事情。
  39:01 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxgnazrp69ph9vpc83h0gkre))
- And if you're stuck on one, go do something else, right? In the sense that I like to give myself a way to cross train and switch if I am at an impasse for whatever reason. And I do that with my writing also. 
  如果你在一个项目上卡住了，就去做别的，对吗？从这个意义上说，我喜欢给自己一个交叉训练的方法，无论出于什么原因，如果我陷入僵局，就可以转换。我的写作也是如此。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxgnchx7h6rppxep0t2c3g68))
- Even though the four-hour workweek is intended to be a logical linear read, so I would suggest that to most people, but the reader can jump around and it'll be coherent. 
  尽管《每周工作四小时》的初衷是让读者能够顺理成章地进行线性阅读，所以我会建议大多数人这样做，但读者可以跳着读，这样也会很连贯。
  42:55
  Just as important but not as explicitly obvious, it makes it easier to write. If everything is contingent on all the pieces that come before it, it's very hard to write in a nonlinear way. 
  同样重要但不明显的是，它能让写作变得更容易。如果一切都取决于之前的所有片段，那么就很难用非线性的方式进行写作。
  43:08
  But if each chapter is effectively a self-sufficient module, if I get stuck on chapter three, I can hop to chapter eight and I can work on that. So I can keep momentum and avoid getting demoralized by an impasse. 
  但是，如果每一章实际上都是一个自给自足的模块，那么如果我在第三章卡住了，我就可以跳到第八章，然后再继续学习。这样我就能保持动力，避免因陷入僵局而士气低落。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxgnddz29bjz9tvmy80hnxrv))
- Yeah, some people are just built for it. And just like there are people who are super sleepers with a genetic predisposition, and I know some of these people, they only need four hours, 
  是啊，有些人天生就是这样。就像有些人在遗传基因的作用下睡得特别香 我认识一些这样的人 他们只需要睡四个小时
  46:33
  they cannot sleep more than four or five hours a night, and they're fully rested, some of them after three or four hours. That is an advantage that most people do not have. 
  他们每晚的睡眠时间不能超过四五个小时，而他们已经完全休息好了，有些人三四个小时就能休息好。这是大多数人所不具备的优势。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxgnf325g3m4spx1cz0exdj6))
- I was having a really good time with that book which was Probably the first time that I could say that. Oh yeah. First three books were very difficult and for Tools of Titans I wanted to set my The circumstances, 
  我在那本书里度过了一段非常美好的时光，这大概是我第一次可以这么说。哦，是的。前三本书非常困难，而《泰坦工具》我想设定我的环境、
  51:47
  environments, and people in my life such that it would be my, not just my writing, but my existence would be as nourishing as possible. Exercise, sauna, the people around, the food. 
  环境，以及生活中的人，这样我的，不仅仅是我的写作，而是我的存在将尽可能地滋养我的生活。运动、桑拿、周围的人、食物。
  52:03
  I thought about all of those elements and also Working with someone who had been my researcher who I then brought on full-time to help with many different aspects of the book, even though I am always writing in my own voice. 
  我考虑了所有这些因素，还与一位曾担任过我的研究员的人合作，尽管我一直在用自己的声音写作，但我还是请他全职帮助我完成书中许多不同方面的工作。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxgnmr80w6rgs68gsm1ctf1v))
- Cal from an interview standpoint has taught me a lot. I'd say the principal takeaway that I have from Cal is let the silence do the work.
  56:25
  So sometimes what you don't say in the space you provide does heavier lifting than any clever follow-up you could possibly bring to bear on the situation and the tendency of a Novice or a seasoned but nervous interviewer is to fill space. 
  因此，有时在你提供的空间里，你没有说的话比你可能带来的任何巧妙的后续行动都更有说服力，而新手或经验丰富但紧张的面试官的倾向是填补空间。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxgnrmnxfwfcfn0vmm0zbxhx))
- I mean, that's a paraphrase, but that's the beginning of one of the chapters in The 4-Hour Body. To pull people in, you also have to do that in interviews. If you are, just as you would be if you're an author, competing for attention, 
  我的意思是，这只是一个转述，但却是《4 小时塑身》中某一章的开头。要想吸引人们的注意力，你还必须在采访中做到这一点。就像你是一名作家一样，你也要争夺别人的注意力、 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxgnsga2fqw8qrm5ar0mc5q5))
- Yeah, and it can be very slow, but generally I would say that is asking too much of your reader, it's asking too much of your listener. You need to provide something juicy that they can sink their curiosity into early. 
  是的，这可能会很慢，但一般来说，我会说这是对读者和听众的要求太高了。你需要提供一些多汁的东西，让他们能够尽早产生好奇心。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxgnssgrg67xzd4d6cb6mgfs))
- you can apply those questions to your chapter if you are stuck on a chapter, which happens to me, happened to me especially with the four-hour work week. Hire someone to interview you about that chapter and record the conversation. 
  如果你在某一章节上遇到困难，可以将这些问题应用到你的章节中，我就遇到过这种情况，尤其是每周工作四小时的情况。雇人就该章节对你进行采访，并记录下谈话内容。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxgnzkh1eas2nhxwv5vm5hzv))
- And I think that this is what a lot of your questions do, which is, how do I achieve a goal that I have for 10 years and six months? What would it look like if it was easy? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxgp3dc66q4ra1vk71esxp0h))
- To a level of detail that I haven't seen shared anywhere. In terms of, not just the higher concept stuff, but frontline practices, innovations, dosages, what are people doing at the frontier, at the edges. 
  其详细程度是我在任何地方都没有看到过的。不仅仅是更高概念的东西，还有一线实践、创新、剂量，以及人们在前沿和边缘做了什么。
  1:12:56
  And the edges could be very modern, the edges could be thousands of years old, but just like at the edges, what are the most interesting things that are happening and what have my personal experience has been. 
  边缘可能是非常现代的，也可能是几千年前的，但就像在边缘一样，正在发生的最有趣的事情是什么，我的个人经验是什么。
  1:13:06
  So at that point, I had hundreds of pages of notes. And then I saw and read Michael's book, which is outstanding. I mean, I have an entire shelf full of this book so that if guests ever stay with me, I can just give them a copy. 
  因此，当时我有几百页的笔记。后来，我看到并阅读了迈克尔的书，这本书非常出色。我的意思是，我有一整个书架都是这本书，这样如果有客人住在我这里，我就可以给他们一本。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxgphd7znjtg520t8pgvb7hc))
- There's that's the interest is in unorthodox, high leverage, uncrowded areas that are also underreported. And that includes quite a bit. And that book would also talk about some very, very, very, 
  人们感兴趣的是非正统、高杠杆、人迹罕至的领域，这些领域的报道也不多。这其中就有很多。这本书也会谈到一些非常、非常、非常、
  1:16:09
  very bizarre experiences that raise a lot of questions about What this human experience is or is not or what the gaps in our knowledge may be. 
  这些非常离奇的经历提出了很多问题，比如人类的经历到底是什么，或者我们的知识有哪些空白。
  1:16:23
  So I do think that book It would be very interesting, but I haven't been able to bring myself to think about the amount of time that it would necessitate. Now that's where I'm making assumptions that I should test, right? 
  因此，我确实认为这本书会非常有趣，但我还没来得及考虑它需要花费多少时间。这就是我的假设，我应该测试一下，对吗？ ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxgq07a2395q207nakfmzdhj))
- The common thread though that makes these people by and large hyperproductive, it's just consistency. And I know that a lot of people deliver this message, but the key to consistency is coming back to the billboard, 
  这些人之所以能取得如此高的成就，其共同点在于始终如一。我知道很多人都在传递这个信息，但一致性的关键是回到广告牌、
  1:27:59
  which is like stop before you're exhausted, would be a better way to put it. Stop before you're exhausted. 
  在你筋疲力尽之前停下来 "的说法更贴切。在筋疲力尽之前停下来。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxgq8e8cqvtwq297hdx55xgg))
