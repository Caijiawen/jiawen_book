## Highlights
- So all of these different buckets were of interest to me. And I begin where I usually do, which is interviewing folks. So I would interview one or two people in a given field and I might ask them any number of questions. 
  因此，我对所有这些不同的方面都很感兴趣。我从我通常做的事情开始，也就是采访人们。我会采访某个领域的一两个人，然后问他们很多问题。
  15:36
  So one is what are the doing on the weekends or at night? This is also really good for investing. It's like, alright, what are the really technical doing at night or on the weekends after they've put in a really long workday or work week? 
  一是他们周末或晚上在做什么？这也非常适合投资。这就好比，好吧，那些真正的技术人员在经历了漫长的工作日或工作周之后，晚上或周末在做什么？
  15:50
  Let's take a really close look at that. Another one is, and I'll create a flow for this, but what are rich people doing now that everyone or tens or hundreds of millions of people might be doing 10 years from now? 
  让我们仔细看看这个问题。另一个问题是，我会为此创建一个流程，但现在有钱人在做什么，10 年后每个人或数千万人或数亿人可能在做什么？ ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hyffza3dpd8008en8jz8s05d))
- Bodybuilding see a lot of interesting behavior in bodybuilding and high level athletes then billionaires, then rich people then the rest of us right so my Assumption is and was for the for our body that along the lines of William Gibson's quote the future is already here it's just not evenly distributed so I'm never predicting the future. 
  健美运动中出现了很多有趣的行为，先是健美运动员和高水平运动员，然后是亿万富翁，然后是有钱人，然后是我们其他人，所以我的假设是，对于我们的身体来说，按照威廉-吉布森的说法，未来已经到来，只是分布不均，所以我从不预测未来。
  19:27
  I'm just finding the seeds that are germinating that I think are gonna bloom and end up spreading really widely. 
  我只是在寻找那些发芽的种子，我认为它们会开花结果，并最终广泛传播。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hyfh0qa9000c0rx5svt541pt))
- I just I had a lot of records and I kept copious notes on supplement use and everything imaginable. So I have what you might call Hyper Graph. 
  我有很多记录，我对补充剂的使用和所有能想到的东西都做了大量的记录。因此，我有了你们可能称之为 "超图 "的东西。
  22:52
  I just capture it almost everything in writing and that was very useful because at various points in time, let's just say I looked at a photograph of myself from making this up 2004 and I think I would like to look and feel like that again. 
  我几乎把所有的东西都写下来了，这非常有用，因为在不同的时间点，我看着 2004 年自己创作时的照片，我想我还想有那样的样子和感觉。
  23:06
  Okay, let me revisit my workout logs. Let me may just replicate the proceeding three to six months of workouts and look at my intake and my diet at the time. 
  好吧，让我重温一下我的锻炼日志。让我复制一下三到六个月的锻炼记录，看看我当时的摄入量和饮食情况。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hyfh3c49p9za5c83vh2vz4qt))
- And I was very in my gathering of data. So I would gather from, say, the web using a web clip were from Evernote, which I was involved with as a company. 
  我非常善于收集数据。因此，我会使用 Evernote 的网络剪辑从网络上收集数据，我参与了 Evernote 公司的工作。
  25:42
  And basically without bias capture as much as possible, put 3 asterisks next to anything that I thought I really might want to revisit after I had read something a second time. 
  基本上，我尽可能不带偏见地捕捉那些我认为读过第二遍后可能真的想重温的内容，并在旁边打上 3 个星号。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hyfh6mbag753qvbvn9m8zvpw))
- And cold water for mood regulation or the treatment of, say, depression or as a preemptive intervention to avoid or mitigate depression is old, used to be prescribed for melancholy. 
  而用冷水来调节情绪或治疗抑郁症，或者作为避免或减轻抑郁症的先期干预措施，是一种古老的方法，过去曾被用于治疗忧郁症。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hyfhve13mykqwba70p296rky))
- I put myself in a high density environment. Next, what did I do knowing no one? I started to volunteer events where they had interesting speakers and interesting people coming to hear those speakers. 
  我把自己置身于一个高密度的环境中。接下来，我又做了什么呢？我开始自愿参加一些活动，这些活动有有趣的演讲者，也有来听演讲的有趣的人。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hyfjj5hrpkt4rrkj3htjcf67))
- When you are volunteering, a lot of folks who volunteer do the absolute bare minimum because they are not getting paid. 
  在做志愿者时，很多人都会做最基本的工作，因为他们没有报酬。
  1:15:36
  This is not gonna get you noticed, but it sets a very low bar so that if you volunteer at these events and someone's dropping the ball or there's something happening that needs fixing it and you just proactively do it, the producers of these events will notice you. 
  这并不会让你得到关注，但它设定了一个非常低的门槛，这样，如果你在这些活动中担任志愿者，而有人掉链子或发生了需要解决的事情，你只要主动去做，这些活动的制作人就会注意到你。
  1:15:51
  And this is what happened over time, over a few months and then I got invited to join in on meetings that were planning future events. 
  随着时间的推移，几个月后，我被邀请参加规划未来活动的会议。
  1:15:59
  And I eventually got point where I was recruiting speakers and able to set the agenda for an entire main event. 
  最终，我达到了招募演讲者的地步，并能制定整个主要活动的议程。
  1:16:06
  And then that's how I got to know say Jack Canfield who is the co creator of Chicken Soup for the soul and many others, who introduced me to my book agent many years later, Jack Canfield but I wasn't nobody then you have to play the long game but you can be methodical on how you play that. 
  后来我认识了杰克-坎菲尔德（Jack Canfield），他是《心灵鸡汤》和其他许多书的共同创作者，多年后他把我介绍给了我的图书代理，杰克-坎菲尔德，但我那时还不是无名小卒，你必须玩长期游戏，但你可以有条不紊地玩游戏。
  1:16:27
  And that is one approach just as an example for how to build your network which snowballs over time. Don't hump every VIP's leg within 10 minutes of meeting them play it cool. 
  这只是建立人际关系网的一种方法，随着时间的推移，人际关系网会像滚雪球一样越滚越大。不要在见到贵宾的十分钟内就去抱他们的腿，要冷静。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hyfjm6wpwcj40g0chx26rc4n))
- I would say focus on the uncrowded channel, which is in person. It's out of fashion out of vogue. Going to a conference and actually interacting with humans in the hallway, approaching panelists. This is another thing that I did. I'll give it. 
  我想说的是，重点放在人迹罕至的通道上，也就是本人身上。这已经过时了。去参加会议，在走廊上与人交流，接近小组成员。这是我做过的另一件事。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hyfjqxhv4f3xygvs2h31g42f))
- And I would pick, say, a handful of panels with topics I thought were super interesting. And then the panel would end and what would happen? The panelists would get rushed by various folks because many of them were well known. 
  我会挑选一些我认为非常有趣的小组讨论。然后小组讨论结束后会发生什么？小组成员会被各种人催促，因为他们中的很多人都很有名。
  1:19:33
  Who was not getting rushed? The moderator. I would go straight to the moderator and I would talk to the moderator. I'd thank them for the panel. I'd be very genuine. None of it was made up. And talk them for a bit. 
  谁没有被催促？主持人。我会径直走向主持人，与他交谈。我会感谢他们的小组讨论。我会非常真诚。没有半点虚假。和他们聊一会儿
  1:19:44
  They generally ask why I was there when I was interested. And I would mention whatever that happened to be. In this case, it was I'm finishing my first book or I had my first book coming out soon. 
  他们一般会问，我感兴趣的时候为什么会去那里。我就会说是什么原因。在这种情况下，我就会说我正在完成我的第一本书，或者我的第一本书马上就要出版了。
  1:19:53
  I'm here to hopefully meet people who are involved a, B or C and then if we hit it off, which was not sure every time but if it seem to be going well, I would say is I don't know anyone here. 
  我到这里来是希望能认识参与 A、B 或 C 项目的人，然后如果我们一拍即合，虽然不能确定每次都是这样，但如果看起来进展顺利，我会说我在这里谁也不认识。
  1:20:06
  I'm really sort of orphaned here making my way through this entire event is there anyone else here you think I would get along with? 
  在整个活动中，我真的有点像个孤儿，你觉得我还能和其他人相处吗？
  1:20:15
  Who maybe I could buy a drink or a coffee and vast majority of the time they like, oh, you should be so and so and then I get the introduction and then I would meet that person, I would have a genuine interaction with that person and if it made sense, if things were going well I'd do the same thing. 
  也许我可以请他们喝杯饮料或咖啡，绝大多数情况下，他们会说，哦，你应该是这样那样的人，然后我就会得到介绍，然后我就会去见那个人，我会和那个人进行真诚的交流，如果有意义的话，如果事情进展顺利的话，我也会做同样的事情。
  1:20:32
  Is there anybody else here you think I should just say hi to and I get along with? Not who I can ask for something. And that wasn't deception. I was being honest, like someone I could actually vibe with. 
  这里还有谁是你认为我应该打个招呼就能相处的？而不是我有求于人的人这不是欺骗我是实话实说，就像一个我真的能与之产生共鸣的人。
  1:20:45
  And if so, would you mind making the intro? Oh, sure. No problem. Many of those people are still my friends. 
  如果是的话，你介意做个开场白吗？当然没问题 Oh, sure.没问题很多人现在还是我的朋友
  1:20:53
  And by being surgical in that way, not trying to gather business cards, to use a really antiquated metaphor, people still hand them out. People still hand about, I guess depends where you're, especially like Boston. 
  用一个非常过时的比喻来说，通过这种方式进行外科手术，而不是试图收集名片，人们仍然会分发名片。我想这取决于你在哪里，尤其是在波士顿。
  1:21:06
  But if it, rather than trying to collect people as Pokemon cards, developing, say, 5,3 to five deeper relationships through longer conversations at an event. 
  但如果是这样，而不是像收集口袋妖怪卡片那样去收集人，而是在活动中通过更长时间的对话发展 5、3 到 5 个更深层次的关系。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hyfjtx6ashst8rphcrvpbega))
- On the other hand, if you're approaching it from the standpoint of developing skills, learning and actually becoming potential friends with someone give you an example you could go after, you wanna become better at boxing? 
  另一方面，如果你从发展技能、学习和真正成为潜在朋友的角度出发，给你一个你可以追随的例子，你想在拳击方面变得更好吗？
  1:23:39
  Let's just make that up. Maybe not the greatest example. Skiing would be another one, but let's stick with boxing just because of the way I'll explain it. 
  我们还是编个故事吧。也许这不是最好的例子。滑雪也是一个例子，但我们还是以拳击为例，因为我可以这样解释。
  1:23:48
  If you wanted to say get personalized lessons from Floyd Mayweather, ain't gonna happen. Okay, let's go then maybe a step down out of the pro ranks to gold medalist. 
  如果你想说从弗洛伊德-梅威瑟那里得到个性化的课程，那是不可能的。好吧，那就从职业拳击手降级到金牌得主吧。
  1:24:00
  Okay, if it's a brand new gold medalist, let's just say like Oscar De LA Hoya when he was really the golden boy and it just thrashed everyone. Still gonna be hard. 
  好吧，如果是一个全新的金牌得主，我们就说像奥斯卡-德拉霍亚（Oscar De LA Hoya）那样的，当他还是真正的金童时，他就把所有人都打败了。还是会很难
  1:24:07
  What about the silver medalist who just had a bad day when he had that last bout against Oscar De LA Hoya? Potentially, right? 
  那个银牌得主在与奥斯卡-德拉霍亚的最后一场比赛中表现不佳，怎么办？有可能，对吗？
  1:24:14
  From a technical perspective, from a personal connection perspective, you may have more in common with that person or bronze medalist and they can get you 70,80,90% of the way there. 
  从技术角度看，从个人联系的角度看，你可能与那个人或铜牌获得者有更多的共同点，他们可以帮你实现 70%、80%、90% 的目标。
  1:24:25
  And by the way, you probably don't have the physical attributes to make to 100% anyway if you're coming to it this late. And you could get in many cases one on one lessons, whether in person or virtually with someone who is of that caliber. 
  顺便说一句，如果你这么晚才开始学习，你的身体素质可能还达不到 100%。在很多情况下，你都可以得到一对一的课程，无论是面对面还是虚拟的，都可以找到这样的人。
  1:24:43
  They're in the same front of the pack as the names I just mentioned, maybe not as famous. Hundred bucks, tuner bucks per hour for a lot of people that is within reach. 
  他们和我刚才提到的那些人一样排在前列，也许没有那么有名。对很多人来说，每小时几百块钱、几块钱的调音师费用是唾手可得的。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hyfjx6qdry0cyd6zackfq7hz))
- So the critical masses beyond enormous. And I do collect and revisit these things. I capture them in journals as well. But I add absolutely capture good questions when I find them. 
  因此，临界质量是巨大的。我确实收集并重温了这些东西。我也会把它们记录在日记里。但是，当我发现好问题时，我绝对会把它们记录下来。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hyfk6rja9sfr5dq37hkybdq6))
- And over time, the more you take these breaks, the better your systems become and the more liberated you are from the day to day. Which means when you get back, you also don't need to rush as much into hyper activity. 
  从我的角度来看，所有这些都不是在使用两个应用程序之间的 30 秒内快速获得的。真正超越一切的体验需要更多的喘息空间。
  2:21:23
  And if you do, you know, that is more from a compulsivity than from a necessity. 
  因此，我每年都会把这几周的时间安排在大自然中，这也是我的首要任务之一。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hyfm15fc2qns00dyx0q2hw4q))
- So the podcast for me, writing the books and doing the interviews, even prior to the podcast, becoming involved with startups, delving into the world of science and scientists, all helps me to develop a confidence that almost any question I could ask, I can find some semblance of an answer for by just reaching out to a few people and saying, who do you know who might be able to answer this? 
  我的意思是，我把时间花在我希望在某些方面更像的人身上。因为你猜怎么着，你会平均到，比如说，这个，这个，和你相处时间最长的五六个人的总和。
  2:32:48
  And that's very reassuring and it relieves some of the anxiety or pressure that people might feel to assemble some personal board of directors of x men and women who can help them with everything. 
  因此，你应该慎重选择。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hyfm5addzdg157rg6rc2ch49))
- So current boxes, I would say the two that I probably identify with most, maybe three, but I'll focus on to experimentalist, which can take a lot of forms that can apply to a whole lot of different spheres. 
  因此，目前我最认同的两个框框，也许是三个，但我还是把重点放在实验主义者上，它可以有多种形式，适用于许多不同的领域。
  3:20:44
  So experimentalist and then teacher. 
  先是实验员，然后是教师。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hyfnp3r83wcz1wbv9r9kaagz))
- Another reason. There's a quote also from a book called don't shoot the dog, which is terrible title, but excellent book, written by Karen Pryor, who was an aquatic mammal trainer. 
  还有一个原因。凯伦-普赖尔（Karen Pryor）是一名水生哺乳动物驯养师，她写的一本书叫《别打死狗》（don't shoot the dog），书名很难听，但却是一本好书。
  3:27:47
  So she's training dolphins and whales and so on, which don't respond to negative reinforcement. You can't really hit them with a rolled up newspaper if they don't do what you want. 
  所以她训练的是海豚和鲸鱼之类的动物，它们不会对负向强化做出反应。如果它们不听话，你就不能用卷起来的报纸打它们。
  3:27:56
  And there's a quote in that book, which is something along the lives of a camera. The attribution is another trainer. And it was, people should not be allowed to have children until they've successfully trained chicken. 
  书中有一句话，说的是 "照相机的生命"。作者是另一位驯兽师他说，在成功训练好鸡之前，人们不应该被允许有孩子。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hyfn3mwef3r1scavpamkvpb0))
