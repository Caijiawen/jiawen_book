## Highlights
- COLD & FLU PROTOCOL
  If you're outside during the winter for an extended period of time
  Your nasal passages will likely dry up
  This increases the chance of catching a cold
  To combat this
  Consider taking a hot shower when you go back inside
  A sauna or steam room also works https://t.co/Gr99C7MxHi ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hubermanrules/status/1732803907842351147))
- "The best way to contend with problems, with issues, with adversity is action, is by taking action. The more you sit and the more you wait and the more time you spend with that adversity... the worse it's gonna get."
