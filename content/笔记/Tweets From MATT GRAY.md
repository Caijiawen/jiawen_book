- Cultivate Authentic Relationships and Foster Community
  At the heart of your brand is its community - a group united by your vision.
  Providing value > transactions 
  Real relationships > revenue

  Set time for writing and publishing on a platform - and commit.
  Prioritize regularity over sporadic bouts of inspiration.

- Your personal brand should persuade the people you sell to. It increases your surface area for:
  • Luck
  • Community
  • Connections
  In most dealrooms I walk into, the deals are already closed - they just want to see my face.
  Brands are now led by founders, not corporations. https://t.co/tHxjkj0XRU ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/matt_gray_/status/1750512245300138455))
- Founders often ask, “Why should I build a personal brand? I’m not trying to get famous!”
  I think that’s like someone saying, “Why should I use a computer? I’m not trying to build Google!”
  Brands are everything - it’s your digital reputation, your credibility, and your reach. https://t.co/uqert0DAAm ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/matt_gray_/status/1750512145790382251))
