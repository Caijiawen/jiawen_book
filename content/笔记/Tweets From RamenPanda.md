## Highlights
- We arenâ€™t in crypto just to flip 1x 
  We are in for that 10x at a min 
  100x if you are lucky
  Beyond 100x is the miracle returns that have happened in every cycle 
  My SHIB buddy did 360,000x in April 2021 
  My total account grew by more than 400x at peak value in the 6 years I had been in this space 
  I cashed out majority of my capital into fiat in early 2022 
  But I am here to do another 10x with my remaining capital in 2024. You can do this too. We all can do it in a raging bull market ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/IamRamenPanda/status/1723822852070142339))
- 2022 was the inflationary bear market of a decade 
  Yet bitcoins total drawdown was LESS than a typical cycle drawdown like in 2018, 2014
  The worst financial conditions of a decade resulted in Bitcoins best bear market 
  Cognitive dissonance for macrotards ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/IamRamenPanda/status/1723923791439417344))
