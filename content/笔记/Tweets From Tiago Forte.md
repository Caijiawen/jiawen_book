## Highlights
- I have one rule for in-person meetings: always take notes on paper!
  The mere presence of a digital device can cause distraction 
  Being fully present with someone is more important to me than having perfect notes ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1695742267053523332))
- Ask yourself these 2 questions:
  1. If you saved (and organized) every idea you had and every insight that resonated with you starting today, and you continued for a year, where would you stand?
  2. What would that intellectual leverage be worth in 10 yearsâ€™ time? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1752663485740089533))
