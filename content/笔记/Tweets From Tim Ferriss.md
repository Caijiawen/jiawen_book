## Highlights
- The key to having more time is doing less, and there are two paths to getting there, both of which should be used together: 
  (1) Define a to-do list and (2) define a not-to-do list. 
  In general terms, there are but two questions: 
  What 20% of sources are causing 80% of my problems and unhappiness? 
  What 20% of sources are resulting in 80% of my desired outcome and happiness? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/tferriss/status/1678948235807711233))
- The below 7 quotes have shaped my thinking and changed my behavior over the last year. 
  I revisit them often.
  “Language can become a screen which stands between the thinker and reality. This is the reason why true creativity often starts where language ends.”
  — Arthur Koestler
  “I imagine one of the reasons people cling to their hates so stubbornly is because they sense, once hate is gone, they will be forced to deal with pain.”
  ― James Baldwin, Notes of a Native Son
  “People fall so in love with their pain, they can’t leave it behind. The same as the stories they tell. We trap ourselves.”
  — Chuck Palahniuk
  “The truth knocks on the door and you say, ‘Go away, I’m looking for the truth,’ and so it goes away. Puzzling.”
  — Robert M. Pirsig
  “Character, like a photograph, develops in darkness.”
  — Yousuf Karsh
  “A man is about as big as the things that make him angry.”
  ― Winston Churchill
  “I will have to remember ‘I am here today to cross the swamp, not to fight all the alligators.’”
  — From The Art of Possibility by Rosamund and Benjamin Zander

  They were all featured in 5-Bullet Friday (https://t.co/wIdFrMI5gi), my free weekly newsletter, which is a short email of five bullet points sent out each Friday. Each edition describes the five coolest things I’ve found or explored that week, often including books, gadgets, tricks from experts, articles, and weird stuff from all over the world.

- When everything else failed, Cossack squats with a kettlebell roughly doubled my ankle mobility, which had a chain of positive effects. Keep your heels on the ground throughout, keep your knees in line with your toes, and keep your hips as low as possible when switching sides. I do 5 to 6 reps per side for 2 to 3 sets, often supersetting with Eric Cressey’s “walking Spiderman” warmup.<video controls><source src="https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1729915573855731713/pu/pl/Jnc1xghdnBj7QwwY.m3u8?tag=12&container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><source src="https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1729915573855731713/pu/vid/avc1/720x1280/BtKSkc_rROPgkCS-.mp4?tag=12" type="video/mp4"><source src="https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1729915573855731713/pu/vid/avc1/480x852/b4BUy7JGNdMuh2W_.mp4?tag=12" type="video/mp4"><source src="https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1729915573855731713/pu/vid/avc1/320x568/hYnCs021hWVA0UIn.mp4?tag=12" type="video/mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video> ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/tferriss/status/1729916611686006895))
- “What am I continuing to do myself that I’m not good at?” 
  Improve it, eliminate it, or delegate it. https://t.co/Lqvat72LqA ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/tferriss/status/1731495398433231058))
- Two books that have dramatically impacted my life are only $6.99 on Audible for a very limited time! They are both in my top-10 list for life-changing books.

- “And now that you don’t have to be perfect, you can be good.”​ — John Steinbeck, East of Eden https://t.co/A5EhI8OBtp ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/tferriss/status/1744053012115374526))
- Take a minute each day to call or email someone to express gratitude of some type. Consider someone you haven’t spoken with in a long time. It can be a one-line text or a 5-second voice note. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/tferriss/status/1744438070663860437))
- The psychological difference between zero acts of creation and one act of creation, no matter how small, is impossible to overstate. If you’re lucky, sometimes that one idea, one sentence, or one shitty first draft can turn into something bigger. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/tferriss/status/1744205362528399602))

- **“The best ideas are when you’re like, ‘We can never do this. We’re going to get in big trouble. This is so wrong.’ When you feel that, you’ve got to stay there. You absolutely have to. That’s where all the interesting stuff happens.”**

- Excitement is the more practical synonym for happiness, and it is precisely what you should strive to chase. It is the cure-all. When people suggest you follow your “passion” or your “bliss,” I propose that they are, in fact, referring to the same singular concept: excitement. The question you should be asking isn’t, “What do I want?” or “What are my goals?” but “What would excite me?” ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/tferriss/status/1750898419512574031))
