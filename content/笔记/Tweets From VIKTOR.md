- If you lost money over the last 30 days, take some time to think about what you did wrong.
  We've been in easy mode, "up only" kind of environment.
  You should at least be profitable when the market is like that.
  Think about how you should have traded, so that you will be prepared to extract the most value out of the bull run. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thedefivillain/status/1725848200446091483))
- $BONK has been giving me for at least the third (successful) time one of my favorite trading setups :
  An explosive coin close to breakout, you can buy it when it's very close to go into price discovery with tight SL for a great R/R
  - If it fails to breakout, you take minimal loss
  - If it works as intended, the profits are massive
  I have also been doing the same thing with $SOL a few days ago.
  The risk is that your SL is hit before it pumps, and that is frustrating. To mitigate that risk, you have to keep the distance to the SL wide enough, but then each time the trade does not work, you take losses... that can become meaningful after a few unsuccessful setups. As always, you have to find a right middle-ground, and there is no straight-forward rule for this.<img src='https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F_UrNlWXIAAdNgo.jpg'/> ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thedefivillain/status/1726336897545289803))
