## Highlights
- List of great reads that really shaped my approach to Markets and Risk the past 12 years.
  Started with online poker free rolls to multitabling pre Black Friday before moving into US equities and options derivatives then Crypto.
  Self taught most of my trading journey as a independent discretionary trader.
  Will keep adding to the reading list for those keen in more resources ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/smartestmoney_/status/1723480582527820260))
