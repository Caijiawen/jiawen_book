## Highlights
- Chamath Palihapitiya took Facebook to 1 billion users, was the youngest ever Vice-President at AOL…and worked at Burger King as a 14-year-old to support his family.
  Here's what I've learned from him about online writing and media: 
  1. Start your writing in a punchy way.
  2. End your writing in a useful way.
  3. Why write in public? “The ability for smart, useful observations to get into the hands of people with fewer ideas but lots of capital has never been better. You can build both a reputation and balance sheet this way.”
  4. Different mediums unlock different kinds of writing. Chamath turns to pen & paper when he wants to write analytically, and to Twitter and the Internet when he’s in a more fiery mood.
  5. Building a culture of long-form writing is a way to depoliticize a company because prose rewards clear thinking via strong and logical arguments. 
  6. Give readers a definitive conclusion. Even if they disagree with it, they’ll consider it time well-spent if they walk away with something solid. The worst writing is ambiguous and wishy-washy.
  7. Fame brings politician syndrome: Chamath says his writing has become more hedged and timid as his profile has grown, and his struggle as a writer now centers around regaining his early voice and spontaneity.
  8. Reading is an effective way to learn, but it's much more effective when you pair it with writing. Whenever Chamath stumbles on a particularly important topic, he writes 1-2 pages about it.
  9. When money gets into good ideas, they become good things in the world. The opposite happens when money gets into bad ideas. This is why people with good ideas have a moral responsibility to share them.

- I've interviewed 20 of the world's top writers over the past six months.
  Here are the best lessons I've learned...
  **1. Tim Ferriss: Have a low bar for inputs, but a high bar for outputs. **
  When Tim was writing *The 4-Hour Work Week, *his only rule for himself was to "write two crappy pages per day." That kept him at the keyboard on a daily basis. But his low bar for writing came with an exceptionally high bar for what he actually shared in public. 
  **2. Kevin Kelly: Don't aim to be the best. Be the only.**
  His writing is driven by the obsessive and unrestrained pursuit of his own curiosities. Whenever I'm with him, I get the sense that he's always fooling around and is somehow so aligned with his work that productive writing can't help but seep out of him. The output isn't forced though. He says: “Productivity is often a distraction. Don't aim for better ways to get through your tasks as quickly as possible. Instead, look for writing projects that you never want to stop doing.” 
  **3. Cultural Tutor: If it was published in the past 50 years, don’t read it. **
  The problem with new books isn't that they're bad. The problem is that everybody else is reading them, which doesn't give you much edge as a writer.
  **4. Marc Andreessen: Use a barbell approach to consume information.**
  His method directly contradicts the Cultural Tutor's. He focuses on what's happening right now while also reading a lot of timeless material that was published 10+ years ago. The things he reads are either timely or timeless, with almost nothing in between. 
  **5. Riva Tez: Writing is painting with words.**
  Passion makes poets out of all of us. You don't need a thesaurus if you write with enough heart. When you care about what you're saying, the language comes out fresh. The formal and logical aspects of your writing need not overpower the soul and poetry. 
  **6. Steven Pressfield: Care for the craft of writing.**
  Steven had tried to send me a copy of his new book, *The Daily Pressfield*, but for a hodgepodge of reasons, I never received it. Insisting that I read it before recording the interview, he drove an hour each way to hand-deliver his book to me, introduce himself for 20 seconds, drive home, and drive right back the next day. He sent a digital copy, and he wouldn't use a day-of shipping service because it was "too important."
  **7. Tyler Cowen + Alex Tabarrok: The joy they bring to their work.**
  You get the sense that they're drawing from a bottomless well of curiosity because they've found the work they're called to be doing. 20 years into their partnership, they still laugh like childhood best friends when they're together.
  **8. Ava Huang: Reaching Beyond Consensus**
  To reach beyond consensus is to write something in a fresh and novel way that’s surprising and memorable. And it takes work. The ideas that initially come to mind for you when you're creating won't usually be the best ones, so dig and dig until you find something that surprises you as the writer, and in turn, surprises your reader too. 
  These are just a few highlights from a solo, one-hour How I Write episode I recorded.
