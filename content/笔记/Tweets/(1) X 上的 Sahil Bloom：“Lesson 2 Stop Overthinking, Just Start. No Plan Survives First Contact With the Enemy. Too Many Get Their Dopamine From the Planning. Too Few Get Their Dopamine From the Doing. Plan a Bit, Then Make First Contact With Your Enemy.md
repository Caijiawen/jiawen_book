## Highlights
- Lesson 2: Stop overthinking, just start. "No plan survives first contact with the enemy." Too many get their dopamine from the planning. Too few get their dopamine from the doing. Plan a bit, then make first contact with "your enemy" and start improving fast. 
  第 2 课：别想太多，直接开始。 "没有计划能在与敌人的第一次接触中幸存"。 太多人从计划中获得多巴胺。从实践中获得多巴胺的人太少了。 稍作计划，然后与 "敌人 "进行首次接触，并开始快速改进。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxe5q9k6gnrws3dvdepyjbcb))
- Lesson 3: Adaptability is essential (and it's a skill you can build). "It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent. It is the one most adaptable to change." - Charles Darwin Life is chaotic. If you can embrace that chaos, you'll win. 
  第三课：适应能力至关重要（这是一项可以培养的技能）。 "生存下来的不是最强壮的物种，也不是最聪明的物种。而是最能适应变化的物种"。- 查尔斯-达尔文 生活是混乱的。如果你能拥抱这种混乱，你就会赢。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxe65p72mtmy3ts9dpqkscdd))
