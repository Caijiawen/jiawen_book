## Highlights
- Lesson 2: Stop overthinking, just start. "No plan survives first contact with the enemy." Too many get their dopamine from the planning. Too few get their dopamine from the doing. Plan a bit, then make first contact with "your enemy" and start improving fast. 
  第 2 课：别想太多，直接开始。 "没有计划能在与敌人的第一次接触中幸存"。 太多人从计划中获得多巴胺。从实践中获得多巴胺的人太少了。 稍作计划，然后与 "敌人 "进行首次接触，并开始快速改进。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxe5q34r7wtdqk35r4akz2x8))
- Lesson 4: You're remembered for your actions, not your words. The world is filled with gurus who talk the talk, but never walk the walk. Beware anyone who tries to sell you food that they aren't eating themselves. Be the person whose actions are always louder than their words. 
  第四课：人们记住的是你的行动，而不是你的言语。 世界上充斥着许多光说不练的大师。 谨防任何人向你推销他们自己不吃的食物。 做一个行胜于言的人。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxe5mnts4jtj7xnzczkwgp1g))
- The lessons shared in this thread had nothing to do with cold plunging (and everything to do with life). Cold plunging has lots of direct benefits. But the indirect lessons learned through consistently doing hard things are much more powerful than any of these direct benefits. 
  在这个主题中分享的经验与冷水浴无关（而与生活有关）。 冷骤降有很多直接的好处。 但是，通过坚持不懈地做艰苦的事情所获得的间接经验，比这些直接的好处都要强大得多。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxe5pax1c0vnjpns0e70txvt))
- Lesson 5: If you want to get better at anything, do it every day. There are plenty of ways to get better at something, but the best way is simple: Just do the damn thing every single day. It's hard to comprehend just how much you will improve by doing something every day. 
  第五课：如果你想在任何事情上做得更好，每天都要做。 有很多方法可以让你变得更好，但最好的方法很简单： 只要每天都做那该死的事情。 很难理解，每天做一件事会让你进步多少。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxe5mrwjgj725ym4dtd1cyec))
