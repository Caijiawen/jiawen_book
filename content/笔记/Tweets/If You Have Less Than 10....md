## Highlights
- Before we dive in please RT the first tweet so that this reaches maximum people. Thanks in advance!
  Now, Let's break it down. 
  Think about how you get followers (organically):
  • You tweet/post/xeet
  • X sees your tweet. 
  • X visits your profile.
  • X follows you.¹
  Simple? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hypefury/status/1700144628425425006))
- What are the two variables in this equation?
  1. Your Posts
  2. Your Profile
  Which means-
  The more views you have on your tweets → The more views you get on your profile → The more followers you get. 
  With me? 
  Now next is the tricky part: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hypefury/status/1700144635052458077))
- 1. Your tweets:
  If you have less than 1000 followers views on your tweets would be pretty low. 
  But remember from earlier- 
  More eyes on your tweet = More profile views= More followers.
  How do you get more eyes on your tweets then? 
  Look at these two tweets.

- Did you notice something? 
  First is a reply on another account. 
  Second is a tweet on the timeline.
  The reply has ~30 times more views than the tweet.
  Remember?
  More eyes on your tweet = More profile views= More followers.
  So how do you get more eyes?
  Through Replies. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hypefury/status/1700144648361021767))
