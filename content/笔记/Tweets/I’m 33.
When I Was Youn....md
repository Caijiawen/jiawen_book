## Highlights
- Prioritize Nature
  Nature is your greatest mentor. 
  National Parks are your best friend.
  • Get outside daily
  • Take your shoes off and ground yourself
  • Never stop exploring what the planet has to offer
  Nature’s not a day out.
  It’s home.

- Remove Negative People
  Negative energy infects your spirit.
  It’s a silent killer.
  Identify negative people with this simple test:
  After meeting someone, do I:
  • Feel full of energy?
  • Feel drained?
  The 1st ones belong in your life.
  Ruthlessly cut out Energy Vampires. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/matt_gray_/status/1698307126139965578))

  And watch the magic happen.
  It’s intangible leverage for your life. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/matt_gray_/status/1698307158142562660))
- Profit > Revenue
  Revenue can be a vanity metric.
  Profit is what actually enables your freedom.
  Remember: Profit = Revenue - Expenses.
  Increase one, decrease the other.
  It’s that simple. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/matt_gray_/status/1698307159941861409))
- Healthy Body = Healthy Business
  Symbiotic Success says that as you take better care of yourself, your outer world improves.
  At a minimum:
  • Eat well
  • Meditate
  • Lift weights
  Entrepreneurs are marathon runners, not sprinters.
  Longevity = highest ROI.
