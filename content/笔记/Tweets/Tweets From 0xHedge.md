## Highlights
- Starting closing out of this short when I saw BTC strength earlier today. Similar to when we have a win, we don't get emotional and we reflect on what could have been done better
  I have noticed that my PnL for trades that I take immediately following another losing trade is much lower and I had taken a small loss on my bitcoin long before opening this short
  I think the solution is to implement a waiting period before opening a trade after closing a previous trade. That waiting period will be longer after a losing trade ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/0xHedge32/status/1724858397407801517))
- Lessons in here 
  - 50% of people will read this and say "but 7 figs is enough". You and I are simply not the same. I do this for the love of the game and will always look to improve. People who do not work to continually improve will dramatically underperform ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/0xHedge32/status/1725609879992209529))
