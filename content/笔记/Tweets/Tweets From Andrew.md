## Highlights
- “One of the most common mistakes and one of the costliest, is thinking that success is due to some genius, some magic something or other which we do not possess.”
  “Success is generally due to holding on and failure to let go. You decide to start a business or train yourself physically. Will it be a success or failure?”
  “It depends upon how much pluck and perseverance that word “decide” contains. The decision that nothing will overrule, the grip that nothing can detatch will bring success.”

- “Always bear in mind that your own resolution to success is more important than any other thing.”
  - Abraham Lincoln ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AP_Abacus/status/1736524647175258197))
