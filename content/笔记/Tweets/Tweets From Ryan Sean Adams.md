## Highlights
- Someone has to say it.
  ETH price at $2.2k is hilarious.
  Everyone out here trading "what ifs" this cycle when Ethereum has fundamentals. 
  Let my tell you why $2.2k ETH is stooopid.
  Ethereum now makes $2.7 billion in annualized profits - the only profitable chain - a P/E ratio of 98 - a slightly more than Amazon P/E of 75 less than Zoom P/E of 153.
  Ethereum now has entire chains as net new buyers of blockspace this cycle - these are called Layer 2's - last wk five Layer 2 were the top 10 consumers of Ethereum blockspace.
  Ethereum is deflationary this cycle - last cycle it inflated 3-4% per year and this cycle it'll burn around .5% per year.
  Ethereum is now further solidified as a monetary instrument - a digital gold - value this as you will - if it had the monetary amplifier of gold it'd already be worth $22k.
  Ethereum bond holders are now earning 5.3% per year - we call these validators - unlike other chains these are "real returns" not just nominal returns - ETH is the internet bond.
  Ethereum is likely to get a spot ETF - it's likely only BTC and ETH will achieve this status this cycle opening the door to trillions in locked capital inflows.
  Ethereum is now fully proof of stake and no longer burns energy to produce blockspace - for traditional ESG investors the ETF Ethereum will be the only one that checks the box this cycle.
  I could go on.
  ETH hasn't had its bull market run yet.
  Idk how long the market will stay hilariously irrational. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RyanSAdams/status/1731706803153506338))
