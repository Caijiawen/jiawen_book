  Your profile could be the culprit. 
  Look objectively at your
  ‚Ä¢ Profile Picture 
  ‚Ä¢ Banner
  ‚Ä¢ Pinned Tweet
  ‚Ä¢ Bio
  Now tell me, would you follow yourself? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hypefury/status/1747696959861797268))
- Retweet your tweet. 
  It is likely that when you tweet, half of your audience is asleep.
  For the other half, you should retweet your tweet.
  Hypefury does that for you automatically, but you can also retweet your tweet manually. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hypefury/status/1748058831899201864))
- Conversion rate:
  It is the number of followers your profile converts out of the total number of people who visit your profile.
  Keep a weekly/monthly check to review this number & optimize your profile accordingly. https://t.co/Re3xXVoK2A
