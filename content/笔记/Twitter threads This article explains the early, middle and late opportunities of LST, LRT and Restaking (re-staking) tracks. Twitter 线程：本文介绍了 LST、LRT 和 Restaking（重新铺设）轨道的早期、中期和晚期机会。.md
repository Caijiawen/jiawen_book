- Summary: This article explains the early, middle, and late opportunities of LST, LRT, and Restaking tracks. LST and LRT are token models derived from mechanisms like PoS networks and secure sharing. Restaking is a concept proposed by Eigenlayer that allows for security sharing between different blockchain protocols. It is important to understand these concepts and the potential benefits, such as doubling the amount of Ethereum with relatively low risk. The article also discusses the opportunities to participate in Restaking at different stages, emphasizing the importance of timing and funds.

## Highlights
- 通俗地说，就是将以太坊的安全层租借给其他协议或链，以达到收取安全税的目的。用户只需向 Eigenlayer 抵押 lsdETH，就可以分享安全税。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmjqxmrnm6kg232e82eh9e46))
- 安全共享允许区块链通过共享其他区块链验证节点的价值来增强自身区块链的安全性。这一概念并非 Eigenlayer 首创。Polkadot 的 slot 解决方案、Cosmos 的链间安全共享和 Avalanche 的子网都是安全共享领域的老玩家。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmjqy0dyyax19t1fqjjjwpq8))
- For example, a small country that is weak and has just developed does not need to spend large sums of money to build up its military power. It can introduce the military of other countries to protect itself and give up some of its interests. This is a very common strategy in history. 
  例如，一个刚刚发展起来的弱小国家，不需要花费大量资金来建立自己的军事力量。它可以引进其他国家的军事力量来保护自己，并放弃部分利益。这是历史上非常常见的战略。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmjqyav11qteb2zq89vd7afw))
- Other chains may be based **on the concept, but BTC is different. BTC has the highest security level. In theory, BTC is more suitable for this than ETH, which is to share its own security** value. The security value of BTC is higher than that of ETH. 
  其他链可能基于这一概念，但 BTC 与众不同。BTC 的安全级别最高。从理论上讲，BTC 比 ETH 更适合分享自己的安全价值。BTC 的安全值高于 ETH。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmjr122nrvwyqbhdpkzskwe4))

  You can pay attention to the fact that the model mechanism is very different from Eigenlayer. One is to share ETH security, and the other is to share BTC security. It may become another big opportunity after Eigenlayer. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmjr1b3q34pa2hzfmjdkjk0v))
