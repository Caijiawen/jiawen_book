- Summary: The zkLink Protocol Docs discuss the challenges of the multi-chain, multi-layer landscape in the blockchain space and the need for interoperability and standardization. This landscape has led to liquidity fragmentation, increased trading costs, and a complex development environment. zkLink addresses these challenges by building a multi-chain rollup infra protocol that simplifies multi-chain dApp deployment and resolves liquidity fragmentation. It leverages zero-knowledge proof technology to provide a high throughput, low-cost solution. With zkLink, applications can access and trade multi-chain assets on a unified interface without the need for cross-chain asset bridges. Users can also manage their multi-chain token portfolios with a single wallet, simplifying the user experience. The zkLink protocol decouples the rollup framework into four layers, allowing for customization to meet different use cases.

## Highlights
- **Security risks during inter-chain transactions.**
  Preserving asset security poses a formidable technical challenge in cross-chain transactions. For example, in recent years, cross-chain asset bridges have been one of the most susceptible components to hacks in the crypto ecosystem.

- Native Asset Aggregation[](https://docs.zk.link/welcome/readme#native-asset-aggregation)
  Applications using zkLink rollup infra solution will be able to access and list the native tokens across the connected L1s and L2s, including FTs and NFTs, allowing users to trade multi-chain assets on a unified user interface. Cross-chain asset bridges are not needed in the process, thus avoiding cross-chain asset bridging risks and bridging fees.
  At the same time, multi-chain token portfolios can be managed with a single wallet. For instance, Alice deposits 2 UNI from her Metamask wallet to zkLink on Ethereum, and then deposits 3 BNB from BNB Chain to zkLink from the same wallet address — as a result, Alice will receive 2 UNI + 3 BNB under the same wallet address on the zkLink rollup network. This hypothetical example applies the same to tokens from Polygon, Starknet, zkSync, Linea, Arbitrum, Optimism, Scroll, and Solana, etc. Therefore, users can easily manage their multi-chain token portfolios using a single wallet with a simplified user experience.

- Liquidity Aggregation and Unification[](https://docs.zk.link/welcome/readme#liquidity-aggregation-and-unification)
  Tokens issued on different L1 chains and L2 rollups by the same entity, for instance, USDT ERC20, USDT BEP20, USDT ARB, etc — will be merged into a single USDT token in the zkLink App Rollups and zkLink L3 network.
  The same applies for ETH. As ETH is the native asset for Ethereum and all the Ethereum layer 2 networks, ETH from Ethereum, zkSync, and Starknet, etc., will be merged into a single ETH token, thus eliminating chain disparities.
  In summary, tokens of the same kind but issued on various chains will be merged into one single token, fostering unified and aggregated liquidity. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmtbrq6xj8n1h8kcxsmyrsz1))
